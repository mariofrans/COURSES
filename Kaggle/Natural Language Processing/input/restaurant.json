used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.\n\nThis place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.\n\nParking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers).","1013":"We have been trying Eggplant sandwiches all over the valley because my day loves eggplant.  Delfaco's sandwich on the Italian Hoagie had way way too much bread more bread than eggplant.  The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot.","1204":"Amazing Steak and Cheese... Better than any Philly one I have ever had... Takes a little while tom order and get your food but that's cause it's so good!! Great pizza too!","1251":"Although I have been going to DeFalco's for years, my last visit was a waste. Two orders of side salads were not included in my take out order. So I returned and received them. Only to return home and find out my 4 orders of meatball subs were not even correct. How do you get meatball subs mixed up? SMH. Not worth the drive since I'm coming from Mesa for what use to be friendly and exceptional service and correct orders of what I order.","1354":"Highs: Ambience, value, pizza and deserts. This is a genuine Italian grocery and I might shop here during the day when the crowds are smaller. The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren't prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\"","1504":"This place creates excellent food. I have been here a handful of times and have no complaints. The meatballs are homemade, you can taste it. The bread is fresh and the customer service is amazing.  I would recommend this place to anyone!!!","1739":"Always good.  One of the best places to eat in the Phoenix area.  I always get the Purista, which has a generous helping of imported parma ham (prosciutto).  Get it with sliced sourdough so the amount of bread doesn't overwhelm the experience.  They have an excellent wine selection and much to choose from for imported Italian foods.  It gets busy, so plan ahead and bring someone with you to grab a table while you order.","1846":"This place has a lot of great things going on. When you enter through the doors you might get a second thought about ordering food from what appears to be a mini mart for noodles and other random trinkets; don't be an idiot! Stay in line and get something,..anything,..it is all good.\n\nI absolutely enjoyed their cheese steak sandwiches. The Italian sodas were always refreshing and they have so many other things. \n\nTake a second to read the owners story it adds to the reason you will like this place.","2309":"Love love love this place.       Deffinelty will be willing to stop by anytime nice staff and great food.","2405":"I felt like I was eating in a storage room. Soup was good...sandwich nothing special.Bread was like pizza dough.....doughy in the middle and done on the outside....Service was very good....might go back for take out and try the pizza. If you ever had a Pat's Philly Cheesesteak in Philly this place can't compare.","2683":"My family ate here on our first visit to Arizona.  I remember watching Guy Fieri feature it on DDD, so we were excited to try it.  I may offend many people, but we were very disappointed.  We ordered a few different items so we could try it all, but we didn't LOVE any of them.  Here's what we ordered (all in the large size)...\n\ncheesesteak sandwich:  way too rich and \"Velveeta cheesy\" for our taste \n\nmeatball sub:  it was okay, the marinara was the best part\n\nfettucini alfredo w\/ chicken:  bland sauce\n\ncalzone:  honestly can't give a review of this other than it was humongous!  it came out later than our other food, so we were too stuffed with the other dishes, that we just gave the entire thing to the valet attendant at our resort.","2821":"Absolutely love this place! Friendly staff, never had a bad meal here, tasty desserts and a great selection of beers and wines!  Can't get much better than this place! \n\nBe sure to try: \nItalian Combo on a sub roll \nChicken Spinach Salad with Goat Cheese\nTiramisu\nCannoli (Traditional)\nCannoli (Chocolate Shell)\n\nHonestly...anything you order here you will love! Enjoy!","3465":"Actually, was a little disappointed .  We ordered the eggplant parmesan sandwich, meatball sandwich, and the Italian beef sandwich. All three sandwiches were Luke warm, and the bread wasn't crusty. We ordered them on the seeded sub roll and the \"crispy\" baguette. I'll try this again because I want to love this place.","3596":"I really enjoy the food here however I just stopped in last Saturday and switched up my order, I usually stick with either the pasta or the hot sandwiches, but this time I went with a cold sandwich. I was rather disappointed. Everything about it was just ehhhhhhh. The bread, the salami, and the condiments were just not up to the standards I had come to love about Defalcos. I will definitely be back but I am going to stick with the hot menu.","5515":"The Il Purista sandwich has become a staple of my life. Mozzarella, basil, prosciutto, roasted red peppers and balsamic vinaigrette blend into a front runner for the best sandwich in the valley. Goes great with sparkling water or a beer. \n\nDeFalco's also has other Italian fare such as a delicious meatball sub and classic pastas.","6173":"I love this place because it combines so many things I dig: sandwiches, Italianism, a great wine selection, and an overall nice casual atmosphere. If I had a market, I'm pretty sure it would be like this one if I could help it.\n\nThe one critical thing I would add is that next time I'm craving DeFalco's on a Saturday at around noon, I think I'll call in the order. It's a rather popular place for lunch.","6366":"I had the anti pasta salad and it was ginormous!  And I had a meatball as a side.  The marina sauce was so good, just what I wanted.  So many great choices, I'll have to come back for more!","7144":"Fed up with the fake Italian Food this place offers. Ya'll are getting fooled big time in thinking this place has any resemblance to an Italian restaurant. One final attempt today was the Eggplant Parmesan Hero. Well the eggplant was a white color and there was no breading at all on that white eggplant. It was one of the worst versions of this classic I even seen and their chicken parm did equal injustice to that dish a few months back. Not sure what goes on in the back of the kitchen, but I can tell you that I didn't see any Italians back there if you get my drift. The seeded roll with mozzarella cheese became my $8 lunch. Not returning to this place and who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes for a takeout order? They just say that on the phone to give you the illusion that they are high and mighty, like a club with a line outside and no people inside. Uncle Sal's is real better up the street. Later Defalco.\n\nOk...white eggplant does exist, but rare. Still doesn't belong in parmesan.","7155":"You should only eat at Defalco's if you have a lot of time on your hands. The line to order your food is really looooooooong and the wait to get your food after you order borderlines on absurd. \n\nOther than that, and if you have an extra 8 hours on hand, this place is pretty good. The cashier is friendly, the food is fresh and  tastes above average and the portions are big, but not so big it is offensive (Cafe Delux I'm talking to you). Also they have lot's of good drinks like Diet. Dr. Pepper in the fountain or Dr. Brown's soda in the bottle. \n\nSome dishes I tried and liked include: Chicken cutlet sandwich, Chicken parm dinner and sandwich, chef salad, chicken pesto sandwich, turkey sandwich, blt, tuna salad, baked ziti, all the soup - oh - and the mozerella caprese sandwich is the best thing on the menu. \n\nOkay, I'm giving it one more star. I was going to give it 3 but I guess it deserves 4.","7217":"This place is awesome!!  DDD sealed the deal with his show so we had to check it out.   You walk in and it's like a little European market with wines, bread, cheese, desserts etc.  \n\nOf course we got the full order cheese steak and God bless it was yummy.   Now it's not a philly cheese steak in the sense of finely shredded beef, but you can taste it's the real deal.   We also got a half order of lasagna and it was delicious as well!   And a side of artichoke salad which was yummy as well.  Getting a cannoli to go and some imported wine.  We'd get more but no cooler with an 8hr drive home.  \n\nThis place a definite must if your visiting and if your local and haven't been here yet your missing out!!","7325":"This place is my new favorite. We went there for the first time tonight and was blown away. The cheesesteak was by far the best I've ever had. We ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken as well. It was also really good but I couldn't get past how amazing the cheesesteak was. Best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at. Highly suggest!","7968":"We can only add to all the other great yelps- this place is a keeper.  Great food at equally great prices.  Always a wait but worth it.  I would love to have a fabulous deli like this in my neighborhood- it is the \"real deal!\"","8482":"Best Italian deli. The food is amazing. The staff is so helpful and friendly. I love this place.","9132":"This place is great. As an Italian guy from upstate NY I have a decent perspective and this is the best Italian grocer I have found in Arizona. I've gotten both a cold sub and pizza here and both were really good. I'd love to try more of the stuff on their menu and buy some of their specialty items for cooking at home.","9167":"DeFalcos is a five star eatery hands down, it reminds me of my north east Italian delis...that being said this is the SECOND consecutive time my order has been heartbreakingly wrong. First Postmates just didn't bring my sandwich and now, they put my chicken cutlet sandwich on a floppy lame piece of white bread with no dressing (despite the fact I was standing by when it was ordered properly by my roommate who is equally at fault for not checking the order before leaving with it). \n\nI. Am. So. Sad. Why do you do this to me DeFalcos?! Whyyyyyyy!?!","9539":"ok if you are looking for amazing home cooked Italian food in the Valley then this is the place to go! The food is simple and amazing! I personally love the eggplant with noodles and their pizzas which are stunning! It's a small place and expect to wait for quality but they do accept phone in orders-so call ahead!","9590":"Mama Mia! I am in love with this place already. Went yesterday with my fianc\u00e9e and 1 year old son for the first time after hearing rave reviews for awhile now. Needless to say, I am super impressed. Atmosphere is a little informal but you are eating at a grocery store! I am obsessed with all the authentic Italian ingredients for sale throughout the store, but the food was the star for sure. I got a full chicken parmigiana sandwich on focaccia bread, fianc\u00e9e got turkey breast and provolone on wheat. Total for lunch was only 15 dollars which is amazing to me, and the quality of the food can be compared to real, homemade Italian cooking by someone's real, homemade Italian grandmother. I can't wait to go back and try everything else!","9642":"This place reminds me of the Italian delis back in the northeast.   They sell everything from sandwiches to entrees to desserts to wine to packaged pastas\/sauces \n\nI tried hot\/cold sandwiches, calzones, and pizzas...all were terrific.  I also tried pasta dishes and although the sauce was decent, the pasta wasn't homemade or cooked properly so it left more to be desired.  For all of the food and dessert this place makes and sells, its surprising that they wouldn't have homemade pasta. \n\nThey sell wine by the glass and bottle.  And they have special prices for happy hour.\n\nDefinitely check this place out!","10959":"Amazing, legit chill spot nothing fancy awesomeness .....good food cheap nice staff. Had meatball sandwich boooomb!!! I'm sure the rest is amazing .","11118":"Very busy place. Nice selection of products to buy but very little seating space to actually eat here.  Cashier had problems with computer so only one cashier available.","11629":"After doing my fair share of research for a great spot in Scottsdale I stopped in for lunch today and boy, was it worth the wait in line. I had a half grilled veggie sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. The sandwich was very tasty; bread was perfectly toasted, veggies were cooked and seasoned well, and it had the proper amount of cheese. But the star of my meal was the mac and cheese. I tried to eat it slowly to savor every last bite. Easily the best mac and cheese that I've ever tasted. The one drawback was between waiting in line and waiting for the food it was a long lunch, but the food was well worth it. Fantastic.","11645":"This place is good no matter what you have to eat. My family and I come here every time we go to the zoo. Their portions are huge and you can share just about anything. If you are looking for really good Italian food then this is the place to come to. My wife an I split a calzone. My kids get the Mac and cheese every time we go and it's their favorite Mac and cheese anywhere.","13011":"My favorite Italian deli. Everything here is good from the salad to the pizza to the pasta and sandwiches. You just can't go wrong","13790":"We ordered a pizza from these guys for the first time Saturday-normally, we get their yummy sandwiches- and it was SO good!  Very fresh and the dough was delicious. Better than Oreganos!  Highly recommend this place!","13829":"This is really an exceptional italian deli!  Great sandwich's - great atmosphere.  Would certainly come again when in the Scottsdale area.","13898":"If you live in the Phoenix area, you must come here and partake of the goodness that comes out of this quaint little Italian kitchen. My wife got the pizza sub and I got the cheese stake. Tender juicy and full of flavor. You will love this place. Not to mention you can buy fresh Italian bread too on the way out.","14404":"This place is good no matter what you have to eat. My family and I come here every time we go to the zoo.

My kids get the Mac and cheese every time we go and it's their favorite Mac and cheese anywh","14574":"I love Defalco's! It has never steered me wrong. My favorite menu item is the beef cheesesteak! And a cannoli for dessert. It's always busy during the lunch weekday when I go, so expect a bit of a line, but worth it. You can shop for your Italian food\/ingredients here as well. They do sell beer and wine by the glass\/bottle, and they have a great deli selection of meats and cheeses. Skip the line by ordering in advance to go.","14666":"Update - was contacted directly by the owner after my previous review, who was very apologetic and sincere and offered to refund me for the bad experience and to buy me lunch if I would come back in.  Can't say enough about the customer service now.  He was very upset about my experience and the last employee's reaction to my phone call.  No wonder he is successful!","15253":"I guess I have to review Defalco's Italian Grocery now that Brian S has posted a pic of me loving up on a package of polenta...\n\nBrian and I rolled across the street from D'Lish and grabbed a few things at Defalco's.  I had a half steak sandwich (a grinder if you've lived north of New Haven, CT) and I'm fairly certain it was the best steak sandwich I've had since moving to Phoenix.\n\nDefalco's is the kind of place I really miss from the Boston area.  Down to earth guys, a variety of good Italian deli meats, salads, cheeses, a nice selection of Italian grocery items, and great sandwiches.\n\nIf only it were closer to my house I would probably be here at least once a week.","15268":"This place very authentic. Lets just say, Nana spoiled us growing up. I have a good frame of reference for authentic Italian food.\n\nI've had some different sandwiches, meals, desserts, and also bought some of their sausage for the grill. They have always impressed. \n\nWe walk by this place sometimes and the smell makes you want to go in there and grab something. \n\nIt's very close to Old Town if you are visiting, and if you're local, you've got a gem in your back yard.","16188":"The food here is very tasty. I've had a sandwich and pizza and enjoyed both. Love that they have a market as well where you can get a myriad of Italian foods and  find some hard to find items.","16299":"Wonderful family owned place.  True authentic Italian that is not overwhelmingly savory, can have for dinner or lunch.","16865":"Best Italian deli\/grocer ever! They make homemade dough, pastas, calzones... Everything!!! And they have the biggest Italian menu .... To top it off there are Italian groceries and some are even imported from Italy!!! Wow!! I love everything I've ever eaten here!!! They're busy so call ahead to pick up with plenty of notice.","16962":"It may have taken me a few minutes to get my Il Purista, but upon the first bite it wouldn't have mattered if it took 3 hours and my first born child.  Defalco's has the honor to be my first favorite sandwich shop.  I have never been a huge sandwich fan, but with fresh mozzarella, basil leaves, tomatoes and enough panscetta to bring my tastebuds to climax, I am now.","17046":"My first visit to Defalco's did not live up to my expectations.\n\nOrdering food at the counter is sufficiently quick and orderly.  Though, I had to ask how I was going to receive my food, because there is nothing to imply they will deliver it to your table.\n\nI guess they simply remember your face or something.\n\nWithin a few minutes, my order was delivered to my table outside on the patio, but I still had to convince the young man that, yes, I ordered a half meatball AND a half cheesesteak.  Sheesh.  Don't judge me!\n\nThe sandwiches come with a small pepper on the side.\n\nBoth were very good, but I have some complaints.  \n\nThe meatball wasn't as warm as I would have preferred and the bread they use makes their sandwiches difficult to eat, especially the meatball.\n\nThe bread they choose to use is big, flaky, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, Italian bread.  I don't like it.\n\nI hate trying to maneuver my mouth around a sandwich that is obviously too big, so my only choice is to flatten, mold, and manipulate the bread to where it is edible.\n\nDoing this invariably creates a meatball mess, because the bread is not properly designed to contain meatballs and marinara sauce.  Though, cutting it up into smaller portions seemed to work.\n\nThe cheesesteak was delicious, but the one-note, repetitive flavor became overwhelming towards the end.  I think it was the cheese they use.  It overpowers everything else and diminishes all of the other elements to an imperceptible degree.  I couldn't even taste the onions and green peppers.  The meat was also barely perceptible.  Too much cheese, I guess.\n\nThough, I did appreciate the fact that I could squish the cheesesteak without making a mess, which was the complete opposite of the meatball.\n\nOverall, Defalco's is still a great place, but personally I prefer Casella's.","17372":"Being from the east coast, i know that it can be difficult to find a decent Italian place out west. I had their ziti with sausage and it was amazing -- perfectedly seasoned and so filling. Their garlic bread leaves a little to be desired but still, i highly recommend this place!","17539":"Like to say Robert and his staff is the most unprofessional and rude staff I've met. We order the italian combo on doordash and since we didnt specify that we wanted veggies on it (which there wasnt an option too) they gave us a sandwhich with bread and meat. 5 years we have been going here not once have we been asked for veggies on it. The italian combo came one way and thats it and that's with meat veggies etc.. All they could say is that its doordashes fault, not there. He laughed and said there nothing he can do for us. After a 70 dollar order, all he could do is laugh and tell us to contact doordash. Well you lost a customer tonight for your little laugh. Thanks Robert","17849":"debating not moving for fear of being a few miles further away from defalcos.  Best pizza, sandwiches, and everything.... oh and the cheese steak is a MUST.","18077":"I start this review during the long wait for my sandwich. So far my experience is negative. I knew exactly what I wanted though the cashier couldn't get it right. When he asked if I wanted mayo, mustard or Italian dressing I replied Italian. Then when he said \"so you want everything\". I repeated no that I did not want mustard or mayo. At this point the guy in line though he would jump in and educate me on how to order a sandwich. I have some angry words that I am holding back from my review about this guy. I told him I knew what I was doing and he continued to mettle. I told him to stop. I finalized my order and was trying to pay when the cashier instead turned to ask the guy behind me what he wanted because he assumed we were together!!! 30 minutes wait and my sndwich arrives. The bread was delicious and all was fresh. Not enough cheese though. The menu should list that the sandwich I ordered is comprised of the spicey hot meat. It was not as I expected. The bread was yummy.  Overall though I have had better thus the two star rating.","19306":"Eating at this deli is like eating at a NY deli.  They Il Parista sandwich is amazing.  The cheese is fresh and prosciutto is delicious.  The meatballs and spaghetti are equal in taste to NY Italian food.  Excellent food and a quant market with interesting items to try.","19768":"When we arrived there was a pretty long line and only one person taking orders. After a long wait in line food was brought out pretty quick except the calzone I ordered. My husband got done eating his food and dessert and I still had not eaten. I wished the would tell you the Calzone takes a long time  but other than that the food was good and the calzone is really big and delicious.","19904":"If you want REAL Italian food this is your stop! The moment you walk in it feels like you're family. I am Italian and I have high standards for Italian food. They also have a wide selection of grocery items, I stoked up for my fathers birthday and he was so happy! Hurry on over and try out everything on the menu and you won't regret it... Until you put on your skinny jeans","20170":"Defalco's is an awesome little Italian grocery that has some of the best sandwiches you will find in Arizona. \n\nOn my most recent stop I got the Il Purista sandwich which is one of my favorites the fresh mozzarella with pungent fresh basil, roasted peppers and the great Prosciutto come together in a flavor overload on a great sandwich roll. How fresh and high end the ingredients stand out especially with the mozzarella as it has a much more distinct and rich flavor and texture than the more bland store bought stuff.\n\nI also added a cannoli to my order which was great. A lot of places make cannoli that is just too sweet and this was the right mix of sweet and savory. The other nice part was that it had just enough chocolate chips to provide a good flavor without overpowering the sweet shell and creamy ricotta.\n\nIn past trips I have gotten the meatball sub, chicken parm sub and the pasta and meatballs.I can tell you that you can't go wrong with any of it.","20372":"Everything, deli take out, eat in, Italian sausage, spaghetti sauce is delicious.  \n$2.00 per meat ball is outrageous though","20422":"Oh man this place is incredible--exactly like a deli you'd find in NY\/NJ. Great grocery and wine selection too. I'd call ahead for your order or be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes.","21201":"The place is cute, the food was ok! The best part of our meal was the sandwiches maybe they are best known for them . We were unimpressed with the spaghetti with and the pasta sauce it tasted like dry sauce and the pasta your conventional grocery store barilla. I was disappointed since there's so many good reviews.  The staple items such as pasta and sauce should be super important to this restaurant. You definitely get what you pay for. Would not recommend","22061":"What a disappointment. It should NEVER take 30 mins for 2 cold sandwiches and a cannoli... EVER! Especially when we were 1 of 3 customers! We've been to many Italian delis in the Chicago area and never experienced something like that. Then to over hear the manager scolding two of his employees in the front of store. No thank you. Never coming back.","23336":"It doesn't get more authentic than Defalco's. I come here for everything! Wine, homemade pizza ingredients, pasta, gelato and of course their sub sandwiches. My favorites are the Philly Cheesesteak (unreal, I don't know how they do it) the Purista and the Portobello mushroom sandwich.","23423":"So much you want to buy. Love the sandwiches and the espresso. Lots of desserts to pick from.","23738":"Hands down this is the best Italian deli on the east side.  Everything taste home made and all at a reasonable price.  I especially like the fresh pizza dough when I feeling like making my own pizza.  Be prepared for a  line if you are going for lunch.","23867":"Best Italian food in the Valley and it's convenient! We call in our order and pick up our food. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but that goes to show how delicious their food is! Another plus they have is their pizza dough! Holy moly it's so good! We do pizza date night with friends and stop there to pick up the dough and some toppings beforehand. You definitely have to try this place!","24055":"The Defalco name has been a staple in the valley for decades.  And reason so, making no compromises on quality and remembering to treat everyone like a friend of the family is one of the very reasons to frequent this business.  The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, the selection at the deli and small grocery section is ample, the service is with a smile.\n\nHere are a few more reasons you should go here:\n\n~Large selection of dried pastas, imported food from Europe, and a selection of canned San Marzano tomatoes.\n~Make a quick stop on the way home to pick up a tasty bakery treat and a cappuccino.\n~Call ahead and order a pizza for takeout or calzone to fill your belly.\n~Stop at the deli and pick up some fresh sliced Boar's Head meats & cheeses or some freshly made antipasti, green salad or even ravioli.\n\nYou can even take a moment and eat in the restaurant or on the patio. As others have mentioned here, there're many wonderful things on the menu, but I will have to agree that the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich is absolutely wonderful and perhaps one of the best you will find; as is the Sausage Sandwich and Meatball.  Choose your bread wisely though as some are choices are better than others for the substantial filling within the bread.\n\nOverall Score:  4.8 Stars\nFood: 4.8 Stars\nService: 4.4 Stars\nQuality: 4.7 Stars\nCleanliness: 4 Stars\nValue: 4 Stars","24367":"Portions are really big and that's good b\/c I always love the food I get here. It's a fun place but I must say that I really dislike the line system. It's just so inefficient but I guess that's part of the charm.","24489":"On our latest visit here, we ordered the meatball sub, and the eggplant parm sub--specifically because the owner sent me a very polite e-mail.  He was right.\nThe eggplant this time was not greasy.  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  The flavors were very delicate and it was very lightly spiced.  Delicious!\nThe meatballs this time were hugely better as well!  Firmer, more flavorful and much less salty.  Yummy!\n\nAs usual, the breads are delicious and the crab pasta salad with dill (the owner said it was his own recipe) was \"smack yo momma\" good!\n\nI'm still having a problem with the desserts.  This time I ordered a Napoleon to go.  Now, let me say that Napoleons are my favorite dessert.  When I see them anywhere, I order one. PERIOD. This one was disappointing.  It had a chewy, gluey, texture.  The filling was just OK, and I wasn't a big fan of the flavor of the icing.  Just an overall disappointment.\n\nOverall, definitely better than three stars.  The owner was absolutely correct, and I want to thank him for contacting me, otherwise I would never have had that fantastic eggplant parm!","24568":"They have the best herb filled and parmesan sausage around, not fatty and all flavor. The sandwiches rock, the groceries sort of pricey. It may take an extra 10 min or so wait but this is not subway. Good value too. Expected them to have an excellent giardineria in a jar, it is still good on a sandwich but AJ's has the best and I could eat it out of the jar plain!","24621":"It is an absolute favorite and authentic Italian food in Arizona. I've sent so many of my friends here to dine and they all loved the food. I highly recommend this place for real Italian food!","24901":"Defalco's gets it!!!\nMy wife asked me to order enough food for 40 or so people, from the Olive Garden on North Scottsdale Road. I called the Olive Garden and was prepared to order 4 of their create your own pasta bars, until I asked if we could substitute one of the meats for veggies as we have a few vegetarians in the family, I was stunned when I was told \"There are absolutely no substitutions on the pasta bar\"! I get it, some knuckle head sitting in a corporate office thinks this policy makes sense... I was asking them to take over $500.00 of my money and was told no...      \n                                                                                                               \n  So I called DeFalco's and they were super accommodating, the manager Robert was professional, honest with the amount of portions we needed and eager to help a guest who wanted to give them business. We ordered a 6 foot Italian sub, a 5 foot veggie sub, two lasagna; one traditional and one vegetarian. The only thing about this experience that was better than Robert's helpful attitude, was the mouthwatering, hundred mile food(worth driving a hundred miles to eat it) they provided!!!\n\nWell done team Defalco's you are an example for the misguided restaurant that puts more effort into policy than serving the guest!!!\nI recommend this restaurant for any of your dining needs!!! \n\nWell done.\nCFC","25969":"MMMMMMMM, sausage, peppers and onions!\n\nFinally made it here for lunch - had been planning on checking the place out for a long time, but rarely get to that part of town.\n\nFantastic Mr. It's Complicated recently bought a car at one of the McDowell dealerships, and was bringing it in for service. I met him there, and we went off in search of food. Happily, he was in the mood for a sandwich (and a beer!), so he was agreeable to checking out Defalco's.\n\nI loved my sandwich! Fresh, chewy bread, flavorful sausage and red sauce - it was a comfort food happy place for me! My dining partner was not quite as thrilled - while the flavor of his cheesesteak was spot on, we both felt the texture was too mushy.\n\nWe did have fun checking out the grocery products - and have some inspirations for meals to make together in the future. So we'll be back - for shopping and a sandwich!","26343":"I don't even know where to begin. I cannot think of a single time this was the suggested destination and anyone in the group declined. They make some amazing food! I LOVE the chicken pesto pizza and if you still think your mom or wife makes the best lasagna its only because you have not eaten it here yet. (Sorry ladies, its true) I love sitting outside, having some wine and just enjoying the food with friends. Amazing wine collection, if I need  to hit the market to buy something I still cant resist a little helping of the antipasto salad. They also have really good desert but I rarely have room left to eat it. The staff is always great too. Please never close....ever.","26591":"Here for lunch during the week. Usually a little crowded but not terrible. If you're in a hurry its best to call ahead. \n\nCheesesteaks are pretty decent, but the hoagies are great. Can't go wrong with an Italian combo. \n\nBest part of this place is the grocery. Stock up on spices, sauces, and wine!","27118":"Many times I've been ignored or treated rudely here.  I feel like I'm an interloper, not welcome.  Maybe that's their thing, but I prefer good customer service.","27269":"Stay away from this place because it's too yummy, you can't handle it. The Philly chee steak sandy made me feel like hurting all the other posers who had been selling me cheese steak lies previously. Plus, the friendly guy behind the register recommended that I add avocado. Who knew?? Flavor shotgun blast to my dome!","27653":"Best in the area for excellent authentic Italian food. Just browse through all the great reviews here...enough said:)))","27786":"Don't hate me. Please? I've been wanting to love Defalcos for decades. I just...don't. Their marinara is too sweet for me, and their meatballs are mushy and one dimensional and ABSURDLY SALTY. I've got a better place to go for a meatball sub to cry for.\nThis check-in we got the eggplant parm, the meatball sub, the seafood salad and a basil, tomato, and mozzarella salad, and a chocolate connoli for dessert. \nThe eggplant parm was TERRIBLE! Underseasoned, and it tasted like the oil it was cooked in wasn't hot enough. It was frankly, kind of gross.  Major bummer! I ate 2 small bites aqnd was sorry that I ate the second bite..\nThe meatball sub was underwhelming and just as icky as always.  I've learned my lesson.  Never again.\nThe seafood salad was delicious!  Loads of dill, you could actually taste the shrimp and crab.  Totally fabulous!!!!\nThe cannoli? NEVER NEVER NEVER again.The chocolate coating tasted chemically.  Their regular cannoli are nice though.  Too bad we didn't get one.   \n\nOn the plus side, their breads are all delicious, the grocery store is awesome, the wines extensive and inexpensive, and the seafood salad is the shiznit! Overall, a solid 3 stars.\n\nWe've learned our lesson.  Next time we go,  We're getting 2 glasses of wine, 2 orders of seafood salad, splitting one of their COLD SUBS, and getting a regular cannoli.\nBTW:  I almost forgot.  We do love their garlic bread.  :)\n\nUPDATE: The owner sent me an extremely polite e-mail.  We have decided to give the eggplant parm another try on another day and I will bring my mom.  She is an eggplant fanatic and eggplant parm may be her favorite food.  We will update y'all when we go.","28231":"Good food, reasonable prices, ok atmosphere, but very rude employees who act like they are doing you a favor....except for the one guy at the register.","28258":"I think that this place is absolutely wonderful, with large portions, great food, and low prices!! You order at a counter in the Italian Grocery store, and I was actually surprised to see that there is a lot of seating both inside and outside. I ordered a pasta and thought it was amazing, and it even came with bread and salad. I ended up being so full that I took over half of my pasta home (HUGE portions!). I definitely can't wait to return here and think that this is one of the best places in Phoenix to get Italian food!","30437":"Wow! What an awesome place!!!!\n\nGrocery store mixed with restaurant? I'm confused... pleasantly confused.\n\nWine selection: amazing!\n\nSauce selection: perfecto! (I'm part Italian, but I don't speak Italian haha.)\n\nFood: great!\n\nService: great!\n\nWill I be back? Absolutely","30569":"Italian is not my #1 choice but my husband has picked Deflaco's for dinner twice in two weeks! We were so pleased after our first visit that we went back not too much after. This place is great in that they have made-to-order sandwiches, pastas, and pizzas and also a wide selection of groceries.\n\nThe first time we went was on a Friday night & it was packed! Even though the line was long, the time it took to order & also get our food was reasonable. I decided to get the Grilled Veggie Sandwich & Penne\/Mostaccioli side salad and my husband got the Calzone & Tortellini Salad side salad. The sandwich & side salads were both very colorful and tasted great.\n\nI think the sandwich would have benefited from having the herbed mayonnaise inside the sandwich instead of on the top to really get the flavor of it on the veggies. I honestly should have just asked for an extra side of it since I always like there to be a generous amount of spread \/ sauce but still, I enjoyed it.\n\nI was a bit hesitant in ordering the Penne side salad because it had salami & pepperoni. The meats didn't have a strong flavor though, so I wasn't even able to tell that the pasta salad had any meat in it (until I ate the pieces of salami & pepperoni), very good! The tortellini side salad was equally good, and in this one as well, the ham didn't have a super strong flavor. I'd recommend either one but if I had to pick, I'd go with the tortellini.\n\nMy husband enjoyed his calzone so much that he got it both times we were there. The first time, he got a 10\" one with mushrooms and the second time, he got the 12\" one with sausage & mushrooms. The calzone was was really cheesy and had quite a bit of toppings. The best part though (in my opinion) was the marinara sauce that came with it. So good!\n\nI had gotten the Margarita Pizza the second time & even the 12\" was huge, I was literally able to get three meals out of it. I enjoyed the flavors that were on it but this wouldn't be my number 1 place to get a pizza at ... yet. I am interested in trying out just a cheese pizza with toppings & the White Pizza too.\n\nOverall, 4.5 stars for flavors, ease of ordering, & the good service (especially considering it's a grocery store). We saw them bring out fettuccini alfredo & lasagna to other tables & they looked amazing. I can't wait to go back & try their other menu options.","30684":"Small little Italian deli located off of Scottsdale and Thomas. \n\nIf you're looking for authentic deli meats, treats or just an espresso done right, this place is calling your name. \n\nThey also have a small grocery store located within the deli.","30974":"Ordered an Italian Sausage sandwich and a Caesar Salad, to go.  It took 30 minutes.  We placed our order at 1:14pm and received it at 1:45pm.  The Caesar was the yellow heart of the Romaine, the dressing is the same as I have in my refrigerator from Safeway.  It used to be GREAT!!  What happened?  The sandwich was so-so.  Won't be back.  Too bad, because their pizzas look great.","31100":"Food was great! Loved the market and seeing things I love imported from Italy! Employees could learn to smile and be more friendly. Heard from other customers that it is usually like this and to expect it when you go.","32084":"Was yelping to find an italian grocery store and found this place, sorely disappointing!  The deli part may be good - don't know, didn't try it, but the grocery part sucks to be honest.  The choices are limited and it is outrageously expensive.  Seriously, $6.99 for a can of San Marzano tomatoes.    Won't go back there anytime soon.","32478":"How fun like eating in an Italian grocery store in the middle of NYC.  Here on Monday night and this place is packed. That's  always a good sign.  Had to wait in line to order, but if the foods good who cares.  I am a Lasagna snob. I grew up  living not to far from little Italy in NYC so we will see.  I ordered the meat lasagna with 4 cheeses, and my husband ordered a reuben.  They did ask if he wanted corn beef or pastrami, which is good. OMG, just like my home made lasagna.  It was wonderful. Would I come back? You betcha!!","33615":"I love Defalco's! It's so tasty and cost effective (all the menu items are really affordable for Italian food with large portion sizes). The menu is huge. You could eat here a 100 times and probably still not try everything. That also means there is something for everyone! My go to order lately has been Il Purista sandwich, which has prosciutto, mozzarella, basil, tomato, peppers, balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I order it on a french role. I only order the half size because even that is quite large. And the best part, it's a ton of food for only $7!!! All the sides are tasty; I like the artichoke hearts and assorted olives. For desserts, I love their Tiramisu ($4), and cheesecake ($4). They also serve wine and beer. It's fast casual style, where you order at a counter and they bring out your food to the table. I will warn you that sometimes there is quite a long line, and it can take awhile to order. It's casual but not always fast. But even if there is a wait, they get the food out quickly and it's worth it!","33995":"Best Italian deli in Phoenix valley , bar none. The service is on par, quality and authenticity of their Italian soups, sandwiches, and salads are top notch. Would travel 20+ miles to come here any day for lunch or dinner. We like getting the meatball with Parmesan with an added layer of Prosciutto. Just heavenly Italian food!","34476":"Defalcos is the kind of place that makes you want to move closer to it.  Every neighborhood should seriously have a place like this near by.  Small deli\/market\/restaurant that delivers the goods and flavors.  \n\nI've had a half beef half sausage whole sandwich on a roll.  It was the best damn roll I've ever had in my life.  Crunchy outside crust, and soft hot on the inside.  Life changing.  The sandwich was big enough for two full grown men to share and came with au jus and marinara.  \n\nI also tried the Italian sub and the procciutto sandwich both were legit.  The shop has some yummy looking treats plus wine and beer. \n\nIf I lived near here I'd try everything on the menu.\n\nOutstanding!","34734":"Tried it once, about 7 months ago. We have literally been back every week since. Rice balls, Cheesesteak Sandwiches, and Penne ala Vodka. Yaaaaaaaas!","34845":"The best cheese steak I've ever had.  Chopped thin rib eye, caramelized onions, a saucy and flavorful cheese melt - no mystery pieces, no fatty pieces, all meat seasoned perfectly on a delicious sub roll.  Eggplant parm hero - awesome thin breaded eggplant with just the right amount of sauce and cheese on a nice sub roll.  \nThe Greek side salad had fresh cucumber, grape tomato, red onion and feta.  All this and they sell lovely Italian grocery items.   \n\nI will be returning very soon based upon my experience today.","35326":"I can only order stuff that doesn't contain cheese, and this being an Italian deli -- most of the food comes with cheese!  I ended up ordering spaghetti, which was good!  Nothing amazing or out of the ordinary, just good sauce with good meatballs and noodles.\n\nI think I probably would have thought the food here was more amazing if I had ordered a sandwich or calzone.  My friend ordered a calzone that was huuuuge and the filling looked really delicious and melty and cheesy.  Unfortunately for me, I can't eat dairy and most of their sandwiches and calzones had cheese.  I wanted to order the Philly cheesesteak - but wouldn't it be kind of ridiculous to order a CHEESEsteak without cheese?? ah well, maybe next time...\n\nIt's important to note that the only tables that accomodate 4+ people are out on the patio.  I came on a Saturday night around 7 with a group of 5 and we did not have trouble finding an open table on the patio.  But it was a little chilly, even though they had 2 heaters going!","36226":"10\/27\/10\n\nHad I not have to wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches, I'd easily give this meal 4 stars.  Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted, I'd like to visit again soon, but recalling how long my wait was, and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager, I am very hesitant on returning.  :(  I did enjoy the sandwiches, especially the cheesesteak, even though half-way through my half-sandwich, I decided it was a little too salty.  I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich, creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant!  Loved munching on the hefty wheat roll, but I didn't care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on.","36830":"Now this was definitely a new experience. A restaurant within a small, neighborhood type grocery store. When I way within I mean within. The tables are set up within the pockets of areas that they fit, next to the shelves of food, by the door, next to the kitchen , etc its really homey and a neat idea. \n\nYou go up to the deli counter and order. The deli counter has a huge variety of salads and sides within out for customers to see, which all look amazing by the way. \n\nI tried the meatball sandwhich, tomato and mozzarella salad and Greek salad. All amazing!! The bread used for the meatball sandwich was crispy but soft on the inside. Meatballs were a generous size and full of flavor. Loved the tomato and mozzarella salad with basil and a balsamic vinegarette dressing.  Craving that again!!\n\nSuper cute spot, check it out if your in the mood for Italian yummy!","37310":"Few places can match delfalcos, only down side is they can get backedup. We have not gotten any sub par food after many visits.","38270":"DeFalco's is a Italian market deli and restaurant that will truly have you coming back for more :) We stopped at DeFalco's yesterday on our way out of Scottsdale and as always it was amazing . The stuffed pasta shells and the antipasto salad are the best I have ever eaten and as we shared a half plate that came with garlic bread I left a very happy mamma .","38712":"Great find.  Little Italian deli and marketplace.  Food was great. Huge portions.  Ingredients are fresh.  10\/10 would recommend.  Sandwiches, Calzones, deserts","39679":"great sandwiches and good value.  Nice grocery store too for specialty Italian items.","39800":"Best Italian Food in Arizona that I have found yet! I moved from New York and this has been the first place in the 2 years that I have been here that tastes like it does back east. Definitely recommend this place. I would recommend the meatball sandwich or calzone. They also have THE BEST  pesto I have ever had in my life!","40015":"Wow! What an amazing find! Sadly, i have to give my best friend and Scottsdale resident full credit, but still...wow! I will now make a point to visit this place at least once when I visit. I ordered the Il Purista sandwich...yum.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the staff was not very friendly...to the point it would have been nicer to order take-out. Oh well, their patio was lovely.","40026":"The food is excellent but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been going to this place for years and I'm on my forth time of telling myself to never go back due to the frustrating, slow service. Hey, I know that good food takes time to make but when I have to stand and wait for 15 minutes to get the food that I called in that I can see is just sitting on the counter well the blood pressure just gets raised too high to make the experience enjoyable. And the staff (other than the new guy that's now bringing out the food) don't seem to really care about the customers.   They hide behind the excuse that \"good food takes time\" but the hard reality is that they are just ultra inefficient and truly don't care to speed things up.  I'm sure at some point I'll cave in and return if I can't find a replacement deli but it sure would be great if they could improve the service.","40243":"Amazing cannoli's and great prices on food. Ordered the fettuccini alfredo which came with garlic toast and a house salad. Would definitely recommend this place!","41340":"Love this place, the staff is amazing and the food is better. The wine secltion is suprube!","41452":"Went in for lunch around 11:15 and there was no line. To order sign directs you to the left register but after no one taking our order and seeing someone else placing an order at the corner register i then walked and got in line there. \n\nOnly get a half sandwich as it is plenty of food. After we and everyone else got our food we all had waited about 40 minutes. They did give coupon for $5 off next time which was nice. \n\nAn awkward cook stated the computer system had crashed. The chicken Parm sandwich was dry on the bottom with only sauce on top. It had good flavor but i would definitely try something else next time.","41600":"Huge menu both regular and deli. Fast, friendly service. We went at lunch time and it was packed and there was a line but it went quickly. It cleared out after the lunch rush. Although I wanted to try just about everything on the menu, my husband and I decide to make it simple and get the margherita pizza. We ordered the small but it was huge. It was delicious. If I'm ever able, I will be back.","41867":"I very rarely write reviews, however lately I have heard some amazing things about Defalco's .. I have lived in Arizona for 20+ years and this was my first visit to to Defalco's..And my last.. I was very excited to try the food as all the reviews are very good.. I went in thinking it would be a back in  New York experience, store is very cute selection of items in store plentiful.. Store\/ deli was clean and well organized. I went to counter and placed my order. I ordered a meatball sub and Ceasar Salad with avocado, service was pretty fast and I took my food to go.. I got home with very high expectations, wow !!  I opened my meal ready to enjoy some great Italian food :\/\nummm.. not so much.. I started with my salad, it looked nice ..as I started eating it I realized there was a gritty substance in it that I couldn't place, upon further investigation I realized the gritty stuff was actually mud\/dirt because the romaine lettuce had not been washed..Really??  Okay I said well I guess that was just an error on someones part I will proceed with my meatball sub.. Being Italian myself I would say I have had some tasty meatballs.. well the meatballs on my sub were not tasty at all, flavorless ..Yes , Odd texture.. Yes.. Sauce? below average.. My thoughts? How is this place getting rave reviews?? I am sad to say that my experience was very bad , and not only would I not return but I would also tell people that the food is not worth the visit to Delfalco's..","42865":"Best Italian food in town! You can't go wrong with chicken parmigiana pasta and if you are in a hurry get the chicken parmigiana sandwich!","43523":"Not a lot of the Valley's pizza makes me happy but DeFalco's along with Otto's in Tempe and Pizzeria Bianco Dow town are on par with NY pizza in my opinion. This place just does a straight pie which is easy because you will eat more than you initially wanted before you got there. We had the margherita pizza with great basil, sauce and mozzarella. My friend hates \"crust\" but ate every bit of it after putting it on the side. I can't tell you how good it was in a simple review. Bianco downtown, Otto's in Tempe and DeFalco's in Scottsdale. That's all I can say for someone who loves pizza.","45261":"Drove passed this place a lot and was always curious to check it out until one day I did. It's a authentic Italian grocery place and the the items you find inside are items you'll never see at an international grocery store. Also to mention the little restaurant inside. I ordered the Philly cheese steak and baklava and couldn't stop admiring the taste of both. One of the best cheese steaks I've had ever eaten! Definitely recommend checking it out!","45553":"This place is unbelievable.  Great lunch spot and great deli.  I've been going here for 3 years, mostly because their sandwiches are so good (chicken cutlet, cheese steak, chicken pesto sandwich are awesome) but they started making pizza now which is equally good.  Friendly staff too.  Seriously, if you don't like this place, I don't want to be friends with you.","45574":"I didn't know what to expect going here. The sandwiches are great. I would eat here all the time if I lived around here. The meatball sandwich and the sausage were outstanding. I think I will eat there again while staying in Phoenix.","45624":"Wow. \n\nReally good food. Really good. \n\nThe sausage calzone I saw at the next table looked amazing. Next time. \n\nMy pasta - 3 -4 times now - always al dente', always delicious. Good meatball too and the whole dinner portion gets a really nice Italian salad. \n\nThe IL Purista is a sandwich, but calling it a sandwich, like Subway, is just silly.  It is amazing!  Get this:  Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Tomato, Roasted Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Balsamic Vinegar. Sheesh. \n\nEvery bite is amazing. One bite you get the peppers, next the mozzarella and basil...all on a base of prosciutto...oh my God is this good. The whole sandwich, as opposed to the 1\/2, is $10. 1\/2 now, 1\/2 for dinner. Sooooooo good!\n\nI don't give many 5 stars, Del Falco's gets 5+ from me!","46739":"Last time I had a bad experience. This time was back to amazing. This place is true authentic Italian food. Chicken parm sandwich is my favorite. My wife absolutely loves the cheese cake.","47785":"Best chicken parm EVER!!! I live in San Fran and I dream about going back just to get a chicken parm sandwich!  My buddy Rob from Wells Fargo brought me here years ago and still this place does the best!!!!","47978":"Such a cute little place to get a great pastrami sandwich. Always welcoming staff never once had a problem here","48540":"This is one of my favorite casual Italian places to eat. Love their pizza and their Italian homemade sausage sandwich. I also buy all kinds of breads and cheeses there. They have good ricotta cheese which I use for my own Italian cooking and desserts. They also have a market and a meat counter where you can buy specialties. You can also buy Italian ice cream there...love the food and love the market!","49188":"Unfortunately quality suffered the past 2 years, but still a good place to grab a quick lunch while in the area.","50224":"I eat here all the time. It really is that good. Believe the hype. Big fan of pasta, sandwiches, chicken and tuna salad.","51664":"Great little place, I love the grocery store concept with the deli. The pesto gnocchi  and pest chicken pasta salad was super delicious and I always leave with a few items from the shelves.","53513":"I Can't say enough good things about this place. I come here frequently for takeout food and dining sometimes as well. Their sandwiches are amazing. Their salads are huge and delicious. Their pastor is out of this world. Plus it's a great place to buy different groceries.","54069":"This place might be my favorite Italian place! The Margherita pizza was on point and same with the chicken parm sandwich! There's so many wines, oils, and much more to choose from that come straight from Italy. Recommend this place if you're visiting and you need your Italian food fixing!","54685":"This place was on tv for its well loved cheese steak so I tried one and I was more disappointed than I should have been I expected to love it but the first one I had to send back the second one came over heated, the bread so hot it broke apart and crumbled up as I ate. The steak was dry even in the melted cheese I was so disappointed it was a waist of a trip.on a side note my wife had a sandwich she liked and the pizza looked good I just had a very bad cheese steak.","54775":"Nothing makes me happier than pulling the car up to Defalco's. Seriously. I'd offer up my first born to eat one of their hot sandwiches. If you're opening up this app to figure out what you should order, listen up. The cheese steak or meatball sub are both divine, get it on the baguette. If you're leaning towards a cold sammie, the II purista is your move. Finally, the cheesecake (how am I not 500 pounds) it is the best cheesecake you will ever eat. Defalcos I love you, never change.","55567":"Stopped in for lunch, love the cheese panini but today I had the meatball, good meat, very good sauce. You should give defalcos a try.","56740":"Maybe I missed something here, but I wasn't impressed. Had the cheese steak, which I can see had great potential but was...well...bland. Also had the arancini and it also was bland and a bit overlooked. Actually it tasted burned. Maybe just that evening but it all could have benefited from some more seasoning. Lots of other really good reviews so I'd likely give it another chance, but maybe not.","56809":"Incredible! Absolutely worth five stars. I shared the chicken parmesan sandwich with my boyfriend and the portion was huge! The chicken was delicious and moist. It was perfectly beaded and not a soggy mess. It came with a generous amount of sauce and cheese, amazing! I would order this again and I'll definitely be back to try all their other hot and cold sandwiches and pastas!","57219":"Went to DeFalco's yesterday and had a great Italian Sausage with peppers, onions, melted mozzarella and home made tomato sauce on a crisp Baguette. The nice thing about DeFalco's is they are willing to give you what you ask for, unlike some other Italian grocery market in Scottsdale. DeFalco's Italian eatery is the hot spot to go for lunch, dinner and take out. They do a great \"to go\" business, all with a smile and a thank you. They have a great looking deli counter.\n I couldn't walk out the door without grabbing a Cannoli to go. That too was very good. So, if  you are tired of hearing \"no or we don't deviate from our menu\", or \"no you can't have a small side of red sauce with your Calamari\", then you should give DeFalco's a try. They appreciate their customers and it shows. They are willing to make you happy and give you exactly what you ask for.","57468":"My first experience at Defalco's was great. I visited with my coworkers and we shared a GIANT, delicious pizza, salad and some pasta. We were absolutely impressed with the atmosphere and the food. We all rolled ourselves out of the building with to-go boxes. \n\nMy second experience was definitely the opposite of our first. I took my fiance as a surprise for his birthday. When we arrived, the employee took our order, which we had to repeat a few times. We ordered my cheese lasagne and cappucino, my fiance's italian sandwich with olives and coors bottle and a cookie. We asked that the cookie and drinks be brought out. \n\nWe sat down and waited. The food always takes a while to come out, which is fine. The atmosphere is incredible, everyone is so relaxed. After about a half hour, our food came out - still no drinks. Our food came out and my fiance's food was missing his olives. So our drinks were still missing and his food was wrong, as well as our dessert. \n\nMy fiance went up to talk to the employees and came back extremely upset. He had asked about my drink, and our cookie and had been blown off by the employees multiple times, including one of them asking the other if I wanted a hot or iced cappuccino and the initial employee responding 'whatever man, just make it hot.' That lack of customer service, infuriated my fiance. Eventually the drinks showed up at our table. Still no cookie I had ordered. About ten minutes later, the initial employee that had taken our order showed up and delivered our cookie to the family at the table next to us, with two adorable children who were delighted by the surprise. They said 'oh thank you so much what a surprise.' I tried to flag him down, he ignored me and walked away. \n\nAfter we finished our dinner, I walked up and asked the same employee if I could then have the cookie ordered - he looked confused, shrugged and asked another employee to help me. The only kind employee to help us the entire night, was then this employee, who seemed to pick up on the crappy attitude and service most of his team was giving to the remaining guests. He was wonderful, just kind, with a smile, offered me my cookie (I LOVE me some italian cookies) and even two because it was so late in the day, but I really don't need that much sugar - going to a late night concert. \n\nWe then had our cookie with the remainder of my cappuccino - gave our dishes to the very sweet busser, who also had a great attitude (the only two in the building) and left. \n\nI am so extremely disappointed because after living in Italy for a year, it is rare to find such a fun establishment with a store, and great food with a lovely atmosphere. After such crappy service and treatment of my fiance, who was trying to correct my order, we will likely not return.","58338":"Best Italian food in Arizona there is no other restaurant that I mind me of back \"east\" more. Everything on the menu is amazing, and believe me I've had everything!!!!! Is a must for anyone wanting Italian.","58413":"If you are from a Little Italy back home then it is the Little Italy food and stuff place you are looking for in Scottsdale!","58474":"I eat here at least 3 times a week - it's becoming a problem. My roommate and I are here so often we always ask about their \"IPO\" (Italian Public Offering). Cannolis are the currency of the future. \n\nI would highly recommend the Beef Cheesesteak - it is my all time favorite. The Caprese Salad is a staple in my diet as well. The mozzarella is homemade and to die for. Other recommendations include: II Purista, Vegetarian Lasagna, Chicken Marsala, Chicken Pesto Salad, Portobello Sandwich and Grilled Cheese.\n\nDon't forget to order a cannoli. \n\nIt's for your health.","58673":"I liked this place because it looked like an authentic deli that was far enough away from the trendy restaurants on Scottsdale Ave. I have to say this place is hit or miss for me due to service and food choice. I can't say everything I've gotten here was good, but I will mention what was good.\nI've had the \"Il Purista\" cold sandwich which includes prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, basil, tomato, roasted red peppers, extra virgin olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. Tasty sandwich, one of the best I've ever had and the bread was soft and fresh. \nThe calzone was also good. We had to try it because this is what the restaurant made for Guy Fieri to try on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. You can put anything in it. I think the best combination I've had was spinach, olives, and ricotta cheese. Seriously, adding ricotta makes all the difference. I had it once with regular cheese and some meats, but it was whatever. The ricotta is just a great touch. Get your calzone with ricotta. It makes a difference!\n\nNow, it has to be said because I think rude people just don't get that their attitude makes a difference in a restaurant's atmosphere and how people feel about coming back. There is this one cashier who just has this funky attitude like he could care less about working there. I'm like, this is De Falco's! It's such a cool little restaurant and they got this dude working there who could care less. Once he messed up our order and my mom asked them to make us another calzone. Well, the cashier reluctantly put in a second order for a calzone free of charge but the order was still wrong. We didn't complain a second time because the owner\/manager of the restaurant came out to apologize for the cashier and let us know everything was okay. Now, that's customer service. He made up for it really and I still think this restaurant is great despite. But it has to be said that little things make a difference.\n\nThis place is real cool though. It's a cute deli that sells Italian imported pastas, sauces, wines, etc. So unique and a little pricey but it's imported stuff.","59025":"Great food ok service. Best eggplant parm sandwich I've ever eaten and I've had quite a few!  Real au jus not watery beef juice with the beef sandwich!!  Salads we bought were a bit pricey but they were delicious. Please comment and follow me for more reviews!","59198":"Hands down the best Italian food in the valley! I usually order the baked ziti with sausage...super yum. My husband and I can split a full order and leave full. They make great antipasto salads and their chocolate covered connolis are fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about the food...Every time it is delicious!\n\nI see a lot of people complain about the service, and honestly, they need to get over themselves. It's a smallish corner store\/ deli...not a full table service restaurant. That being said, the people who work there have always been friendly and accommodating. The food does some times take a while, but it is well worth the wait...and the price!\n\nAnother word to the wise...this place is always busy, it's definitely a local spot and close to ASU so you won't be able to avoid a lunch rush if you head over after 1, so give yourself some extra time to stand in line to order and then to wait for your food.\n\nTheir grocery is pretty cool, they have quite a few things I haven't been able to get elsewhere and a HUGE selection of wine. (They offer wine selections with their food too)\n\nThis is definitely one of my favorite spots! I highly reccomend it!","60741":"This is an unusual place. A delicious unusual place.\nIt is often confused as just an Italian grocery. At least that is what I thought as I drove by many times.\nNow it is my go-to for Italian takeout. (It also has an eat in deli style seating blended in between the grocery shelves)\nI have tried a wide variety of their items. From sandwiches to pasta and even their cannolis. Everything was delicious and tasted freshly made unlike the Olive Garden variety of Italian restaurants.\nWhat makes it great, however, is their prices. Their rates are great considering the quantity and quality of the food.","60828":"One of the best Italian grinders I've experienced. Bread and ingredients are super fresh. Hard to go wrong eating in a Italian grocery store. Great staff as well.","61019":"Great food! Really horrible service. I was there yesterday and the man waiting on us (we are they frequently). The man who was tall with grey hair and a mustache had a hard time taking an order and was getting frazzled that I wanted just one 2.00 meatball which was offered on the menu. It started to get weird... He asked my mom if she was from New York (a car parked outside had NYC plates) she said no that it wasn't her car. He continued to say that she was acting like one, (whatever that means) and continues to say how he wanted to punch al New Yorkers in I the mouth. I was shocked at the fact that he oddly threatened my mother and would do so in such an open environment. Needless to say not going back. At least subway doesn't condone violence among women.","61196":"Yep, Like they all said, quality food @ reasonable prices. This is Phoenix, not Chicago or New York with great neighborhood places everywhere, so we're lucky to have Defalco's. Been going there for about 20 years since they were on Thomas. My only complaint is the bread seems to have changed. The Baguette seems more like a regular sub roll where it used to be much more crunchy.","62404":"As an East Coast transplant, I have been on a search for authentic Italian and imported goods from Italy. Score! Defalco's Italian Grocery is a cafe with salads, pizza, sandwiches (hot and cold), pasta, and soups that are made to order. They have a delicious pastry cold case with lemon bars, cannolis, and various Italian desserts. Biscottis are made fresh daily and so is their mozzarella. The seating is limited so it's not the best place for group meet ups but there is more room on the back patio. \n\nAfter travelling throughout Italy, there are certain staple products that I love and, hooray, they are here. Whether it be cheeses, meats, packaged pasta, canned tomatoes, almond syrup etc, you're sure to come across some great finds. It's a small store - it actually looks like it could be in Italy with their use of all available space - but definitely worth a trip. \n\nImported beer and beverages available too!","63022":"The best sandwiches ever. I frequent this place, only thing to remember is its old school Italian deli, so be patient, the good food will arrive.","63471":"Been coming here for years.  I've never seen so many unhappy employees. Smile once in awhile.  I bought a cold combo Italian sub. Huge nice tasty sub roll with literally 1-2oz of meat.  Supposed to have mustard-none, sparse amount of Italian dressing. Over $ 9.00 and a 25 minute wait for my to go order.","63978":"This place is amazing every single time! Every single thing I have ever got here was simply incredible! Very quick with getting the food out, clean, friendly and great atmosphere! You can even take your pups on the patio  reminds me of the amazing Italian food back in PGH! Love this place!","64113":"Been here a couple times. Wasn't amazed with the service the first time. Can't remember what I thought of the food. Decided to give it another shot and ordered a pizza for pickup. They said it would be ready in 30-35 min. Got there in plenty of time. Took it home and was completely cold. Had to warm it up in the microwave which basically turned it into cardboard. Spent $25 on a pizza I could have gotten at Papa Johns for probably $8. Won't be back for a third time.","64190":"The sandwiches are very tasty - I've liked every one that I've tried so far.  The pizza we had last time we were there - not likely will ever be ordered again.  Maybe I'll try a pasta dish next time I'm there.  :)","65029":"This sounds strange...I know.  When I went in I saw on their menu that they had a Pepperoni and Egg sandwich.  And I figured, \"When in Rome...\"  Right?\n\nIt was absolutely delish!  \n\nI had no idea what kind of egg it would be...hard boiled? Over easy?  Fried? Scrambled?\n\nI recommend this sandwich.  Totally.\n\nThe prices are kinda high.  My sandwich alone was $7.  And my friend's pizza was about $12.\n\nBut the food was pretty good.  We walked in and got what we wanted.","65672":"I love coming here for the chef salad and pizza (sorry ate that too fast before I took a picture). It's an Italian lovers dream as they sell everything authentic Italian cuisine grocery style too. While you order you can pick out your pastas, wine, and treats to go. Finally, someone caries lupini beans and spumoni.","65769":"Had to check out DeFalco's after seeing all the popularity on Food Network shows and such. Now I drag everyone I know here first chance I get.\n\nFOOD: Some of the best Italian sandwiches I've ever had outside of New York City. My favorites that I never stray from: Chicken Parm Sandwich on Foccacia Bread (the Foccacia is perfect for this sandwich, trust me) and their Calzone. I have to mention that I'm not a big fan of Calzones, but this Calzone is life changing. No, seriously. The dough is always perfectly cooked and the cheese is overflowing but also not too much to handle, it's in balance with the dough and whatever toppings you put inside. Their Centurion Calzone is mind blowing. And, if you think it's expensive, just know that a small Calzone is huge and worth at least two meals unless you haven't eaten all day. If you get the larger Calzone, prepare for 4+ meals out of it. Last but not least, their marinara sauce they give for dipping is a one-of-a-kind family recipe and straight up, I'm not kidding, I will drink it straight from the cup they give you. I've done it before and I'll do it again, but only after I pour it all over where it truly belongs in harmony with the dough and cheese.\n\nSERVER: They bring your food out to your table with your number, but no real server here. They'll bring anything condiment-wise or silverware that you need if you ask, though. Neither good nor bad, average.\n\nHOSTING: No hosting, just order in line like a deli shop.\n\nAMBIANCE: Casual, comfortable deli-like atmosphere. Sometimes I feel like the staff could be a bit friendlier, but meh.\n\nThe food here has always been of amazing quality and consistency and absolutely delicious. Come here as soon as you can.","65994":"Defalco's rates five stars for me because every dish on the menu that I have tried tastes fabulous. I found Defalco's the first week during my initial scouting trip to Arizona a few years ago.\n\nAfter my first taste of their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I was hooked. I love the meatball sandwich as well. But my favorite is definitely the Italian Sausage served with roasted green peppers and onions with the marinara sauce on the roll of your choice. Talk about foodie nirvana; The Italian Sausage sandwich does it for me.\n\nI keep coming here because the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable. One time my family members ordered half sandwiches of the same item and they gave us the full sandwich pricing which was a discount from half sandwich pricing. They didn't have to do that. But that's just one of the ways that they look out for their customers. This place gets really busy and it can be a challenge to find seating during the busy lunch and dinner hours.  They also have a thriving deli.\n\nOne of these days I've got to try the pizza.","67481":"Maybe it's just the me growing up\nIn a small Italian community when I was going up many moons ago but I loved Defalco's. It's an Italian grocery store with seats for dining. The pizza was like momma used to make. The geek salad was good and my picky wife loved the pasta. Definitely going back!!","68230":"This place is sooooo awesome! Food is as close to Italy without buying an airline ticket! It's been a favorite stop for years and the many others dining and grocery shopping prove their perfection.  The imported mortadella with pistachios is something I haven't been able to find since I lived in San Francisco! Thank You Defalco's!! Worth the drive from anywhere!! I can take the 72 bus from Tempe and be there in no time! Patricia St Vincent, Maple Ash  neighborhood, Tempe","68277":"Great for a take away Italian lunch - I've never not seen it busy here during lunch hours! If you're trying to dine in, best of luck in finding a free table.","69762":"Great food and pretty good prices on the food. It's a little pricey when it comes to grocery, but average for a specialized grocer. Also, you're buying a different quality then at a Fry's or something. Could use a bit more seating and\/or a few less shelves in there as it can get very hard to get around.","70344":"One of my boyfriend and I's favorite place! Amazing veggie sandwich and pizza! The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the last time we picked up a pizza, there was not much cheese and it tasted like it had been sitting out all day. Other than that, this place is great!","70456":"Great deli and Italian market. Gnocchi, sammich's, gelato and various other boot country fair. Be prepared for a wait this place is kinda slow and very busy, but that's because it's good!","70861":"i love this place, fresh made to order subs and sandwiches, the eggplant parmesan sub is awesome, hot and crispy, with a great marina and cheese, its not like the heavy overbaked trays of eggplant parmesan  thats usually soggy, , i have it with only a bit of that great gravy so its not messy, nice deli counter, very friendly staff. and the brick oven pizza is to die for, has a del counter, fresh imported cheeses , assorted fresh and dried pastas, nice market.","70886":"Loved my sandwhich and great service. Will definitely back when on this side of town!","70924":"Everyone knows that Tony Soprano didn't die, HBO merely made the ending ambiguous so that America would be shielded from the awful truth that he was planning to move away from the East Coast to none other than Scottsdale, Arizona. Why you ask? Because where else can you carry on business dealings in a strip joint, be involved in \"waste management\", act out of control all the time, philander, defraud the government...and fit right in? But for he and many other recent transplants from Jersey, the truth is part of Scottsdale's allure rests with places like DeFalco's Italian Grocery.\n\nSitting in a worn strip mall in an older section of town, the scene almost evokes a little hint of the Garden State. However, the good news is that I've never seen anyone whacked in the spacious parking lot...or wearing a Members Only jacket for that matter. Upon entering, there's a claustrophobic sensation as you see the grocery aisles creating a slightly labyrinthine path to the deli counters, which are separate based on ordering prepared or raw food. Upon reaching the prepared food aisle, you'll invariably see a microcosm of Scottsdale, ranging from senior citizens to high schools girls using platinum cards to buy lunch for the whole family. (Luckily though, no sign of Carmine Gotti just yet.) \n\nThe menu? It's a pageant of sumptuous meats and cheeses, and they even offer I-talian soda to go with. It's so good, you might think like many a famous eatery it's a front for the local outfit. While I don't believe that to be true...(it is Arizona after all) the owners certainly make purists and old school Italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo. The food also will seem dry, but that's only because they are careful not to drown out the meat's character with too much mayo or other condiments. Some may not like it.\n\nPrice-wise, this place is pretty much a steal. It's a shade more expensive than Subway, but not much more-so. But as Scottsdale goes, it's almost unbeatable. They also accept plastic and have a loyalty card, so as you can imagine, you'll want to come back often if you know what is good for you.\n\nSince it's a deli, there's no waitstaff. Still, service is total class. People are friendly, and professional so that it still feels family-owned and not corporate. The tables are usually clean in the seating area, and spaced evenly enough that you won't feel like someone just broke your legs.\n\nBut then there is the one detraction to this place: the supposedly endless wait for your order. I've never been on a weekday, but weekends I have found are pretty manageable. For some people it won't  be like Jack-in-the-Box, but if you order ahead you should avoid some of the hassle.\n\nOf course, part of the allure going to an Italian restaurant in the cultural attitude about savoring life, food and a slower pace than our Anglo-Saxon roots ultimately prefer. Unless, that is, you have reservations to Buca di Beppo...but that's another story entirely.","71138":"The food was great; Calzone, Ravioli, and Linguine were all yummy. They use fresh ingredients and fresh mozzarella.\nThe dine in seating area is very small and limited.","71288":"My husband and I are obsessed with this place! We love the pizza and their subs! It's a good size and the prices are great! I've tried a few of their pastas but I'm not mind-blown. I personally like the sandwiches, pizzas, and the dessert. Their philly cheese steak is so so delicious! My husband loves their pizza sub. Also, their cheesecake and tiramisu are to die for and they are not expensive at all! I can't wait to have a date night again, I miss the tiramisu and sub. Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!","71896":"Defalco's is a neighborhood favorite and the only place in Phoenix that my picky Philadelphian boyfriend will order a cheesesteak! The place is small and kind of cluttered, but there's no denying its charm or quality! Half grocer, half deli, Defalco's is legitimate Italian cuisine, and I constantly meet people who've lived in Italy (or that are from traditional italian families) picking up groceries there. (The biscotti are wonderful!)\n\nWhen going in for lunch, I highly recommend calling ahead, as there's typically a long wait to get food on your lunch hour. The hot sandwiches are great (chicken pesto being my favorite!), and the salads are decent. I had the chicken pesto salad last time, which was a little heavy on the dressing, but still good.\n\nAll in all, if recommend if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive lunch with fewer than 5 people. Beyond that, seating is difficult. Call in your order to expedite the wait time!","73175":"A great Italian deli on par with the best Italian delis in the US. I  tried 6 or 7 dishes. I was thoroughly satisfied with how authentic and fresh the food was. This is a standout Italian eatery amongst a lot of competition in Scottsdale.","73690":"I didn't post this review last week and was scrolling through my phone, saw the picture and remembered I still needed to write a review. So here it goes... \n\nLast week's lunch adventure was going to eat at DeFalco's in Scottsdale (fancy), actually when you walk in it really isn't that fancy.  It is a real authentic deli with a line out the door and people running out with food calling out names. We went around lunchtime so of course it was packed.  I ordered the spinach and cheese arancini (riceballs) and it was so good. It was the size of a baseball nestled in marinara sauce. It was perfectly fried and moist inside. I could not eat the whole thing, I had maybe 4 more bites left but I could feel the heart burn coming- it was my fault for not taking an acid reducer prior to going.   \n\nApparently the food networks Guy Fieri was here filming diners, drive ins and dives so it has to be good right? The people are very friendly and service is quick even though they warn you it will take a while.  Once a table has cleared of customers, someone is out to clean it up within moments so they are always clean.\n\nDid I mention it is grocery store too?  You can buy gelato, different types of cheeses, bread and noodles in every single shape and size. Another plus, they have wine AND you can buy their premade pizza dough for $1.99 that is a steal in my opinion. \nI would love to come back and have some more food. But it would be wise to come alittle bit before the lunch rush.","74044":"Best cheese steaks I've ever had. \n\nThe Spaghetti and meatballs are an amazing duo as well.\n\nTry the Pizza. Its Fantastic.\n\n\"But what about Philadelphia and New York?!?!\" \nShut up, homers. Go back and sniff your own pretentious farts.\n\nFinally, the chicken parm sandwich is out of this world. An ideal situation is to bring a friend and get one whole chicken parm and one cheese steak with everything, so you can get the best of both worlds. Every time I have someone in town, I force them to go to Defalco's, and I have never seen a disappointed face.","75026":"The only thing I hate about this place is how many times I should be going there for lunch and forget about it. \n\nWe've ordered takeout here for work on several occasions, and just recently I was able to eat at Defalco's for the first time. What I've realized? The line is absolutely well worth it. I've tried to order a different sandwich every time and every time it's been just as amazing as the last, if not better.\n\nI love how the line goes through the store, allowing you to see all the wines, beer options, foods you can buy and the deli section in slow motion before you make it to the counter. Next time I am definitely getting the German potato salad!\n\nTwo minor issues I had with eating in last time:\n1)  One of the displayed beers, a microbrew I look forward to every year, wasn't actually available.\n2) Upon going up to the counter to get a refill on my beverage the man taking orders was very upset. He told me the people in the line were gonna come after me. And I'll stop there. I think this took longer than actually refilling my drink.","75359":"First visit on quite sometime but very pleased. Definitely not a 5 star restaurant but good food served in an Italian grocery. I'll go back.","75732":"Defalco's is half Italian grocery store and half restaurant. The ambiance is very authentic. I had the Italian sausage sandwich which was the featured item on the \"Diners Drive Ins and Dives\" episode. It was pretty good but nothing too special. I also had the penne with vodka sauce and I thought that was better than the sandwich. On the side I ordered a meatball to have with the pasta and that was good as well. For dessert, I had a cannoli which was great. I also had the chance to talk to the owner who was also in the \"Diners Drive Ins and Dives\" episode and he seemed like a genuine guy. Overall, great experience and can't wait to come back to try more items on their menu.","76831":"I love this place! Everything about it! The great food, the grocery section, the cramped seating (it gives character). It all goes together perfectly. Haven't found one bad thing yet:)","76869":"Easily my favorite homemade Italian food joint. Prices are a bit high if you weren't expecting the quality but trust me, it's well worth it. Get anything and I promise you will enjoy it.","76872":"While I agree the service is slow, it is worth the wait.  This was my first visit and I am so upset with my husband for not sharing this place with me sooner.  I had the pasta with clam sauce and it was delicious.  My husband had the II Purista sandwich and I could have at that one as well.  The bread is good a little rough on the outside but nice and soft on the inside...perfection.  Love the \"market\" inside, it make for waiting for your meal that much more exciting.","77043":"The classic Italian combo on marble rye was devoured before a pictures could be snapped. Wished I had order a full sandwich but had to save room for a slice of original cheese that towered high. Officially the tallest cheesecake I have ever seen and what a delicious slice. Pair with a pleasant shot of espresso this meal was beyond memorable. Will be back next time I am in Scottsdale! Thank you!","77783":"The place for lunch.\n\nI'm happy whenever I work in Scottsdale as that usually means lunch at DeFalco's.  This place is an institution in this part of town and the consistent crowds attest to its reputation.\n\nThe philly cheese steak sandwich is so good that I rarely get up the courage to try something else.","78172":"I remember the original in a strip mall that I used to go to all the time.  The new location is also in a strip mall, but it's cleaner and bigger.  Great place for a sandwich.  They even have giardiniera.  Nice folks run this place and it is always packed.  Go here if you get a chance.","78429":"I am a mac and cheese connoisseur. Defalco's has THE best mac and cheese I have ever had!","78555":"This place is a classic spot to grab a great chicken parm sandwich or a bottle of your favorite olive oil. It's always busy and sometimes the tables are limited if you want to dine in.","78655":"Stopped by there this morning when they opened at 10.  \n\nThey have two counters, one for meal type orders and another for the deli (sandwiches). A gentleman was at the meal counter ordering and I walked up to the deli counter.\n\nNo one was working the deli yet so I waited. A few minutes passed, people walked in and out of the kitchen, the other guy was still doing a long order.  I passed the time by checking out my phone.\n\nAnother customer got behind me in the deli line.  He also pulled out his phone after a couple of minutes as well.  We were both just hanging out when he strikes up a conversation.  I was surprised to hear an older guy with a heavy accent quoting a line from Ferris Bueller so I give him props for that.\n\nWe fiinished our chat, the meal line was on to the next customer, workers were coming in and out, stocking shelves, Another person got behind us in the deli line.\n\nBy this point I was getting pretty hungry so I left the restaurant to get something to eat.","79608":"It was ok. I came bc I had seen this on DDD and to be honest I wouldn't come again. The bread is WAYYY too thick. I ordered the chicken Alfredo and the chicken was an overly seasoned fries chicken breast. The sauce was good though. The pizza my kids got was ok but the Italian sandwich wasn't what I expected. Too much bread made everything dry.","80131":"this is a great italian grocery, and they have delicious prepared foods.  I love their antipasto salad!  Stop in to grab lunch or to get some authentic Italian staples for your pantry.","81926":"Good for the price and portions you get.  Was the lasagna awesome? No. But it was OK. Was the pizza awesome? No but it was OK. But you get a huge portion. Kinda the story with this place. Half the tables had not been bussed and it just makes the place look messy, which is not a good look for a restaurant.","81988":"Best place in my neighborhood!  Good food for a fair price; love the value.","82157":"In a suburban sprawl filled with bland, recently franchised chains speckled everywhere, this deli shines like a diamond in the rough.  I love this place. It is my favorite deli in the Phoenix metro area.  Anyone that moves here from a place with good delis (like say... New York or Philly) will be sold after the first trip.  It's not dirt cheap, but high quality food is worth the moderate price.\n\nIf you're wondering what to expect, imagine this: a mafia informant got relocated to Arizona. His wife was feeling lonely so he brought his father-in-law over from the Old Country to keep her happy.  Being a cranky old codger, the pater familia became annoyed at the lack of quality delis in the Phoenix sea of chain restaurants.  So he started a little place where he could get good pasta, good sandwiches, and quality groceries when he wanted Mama to make some stuff at home.  And it's staffed by people who all speak english clearly... even if they have a mexican accent.\n\nThe service can be a little slow, but it's worth the wait if you've got 20-30 minutes to spare.  I don't have any kids, but I would gladly give up someone else's first-born for one of their \"il purista\" sandwiches.","82412":"We arrived last night at 6:05 and the line was not long but certainly busy.  We ordered Chicken Alfredo, Spaghetti and Meatball, Eggplant Parm and the il Purista.  The food all in was solid with a couple of snags.  I saw reviews about slow service, and that is the rub.  We had two couples and we ordered back to back.  The first order came about 15 minutes later, which is no problem.  After my wife and I had waited a full 30 minutes and our dining partners were nearly done eating we went and found someone to help us.  They brought us the food then, and while good, the Alfredo was lukewarm, meaning it was sitting up there ready.  WTH?  I suspect the issue is with their numbering system which is out of sync.  We watched a table that ordered 10 behind us get served far before us.  Why?  They had the number 24 and we had the number 45.  Just a guess that the delivery guy was picking off the lower numbers, or going random.  Either way their is no first in first out process in place.  We will go back, and expect to have to bird dog our order.","83925":"This place is GOLDEN! Try the Spaghetti and Meatballs or the Stuffed Shells. It is set up like a mom and pop type of place with a store inside. You can buy wine from Italy among all kinds of things. Last but not least GET THE CANNOLI - I don't care what kind of diet you are on and if you only get a salad for your meal but I'm telling you, you haven't tasted heaven until you've had one of their cannolis.","83948":"Defalcos is great, I had the chicken Alfredo and my lunch date had the cheese steak sandwich. Both were absolutely wonderful! I had no problem with the wait because I knew that the food would be worth it, as I read from other people's reviews. The service was friendly, and it had a real down to earth atmosphere :)","84407":"This place is top notch when it comes to fresh deli sandwiches! Everything I order is always great and I've never had an issue or a bad meal. Just get there early or late to avoid the lunch rush or call your order in for pickup.\n\nThe groceries are authentic and interesting, its fun to look through them all and try to figure out what you can create in your own kitchen.\n\nWorth the stop if your in the area!","84575":"Awesome and large menu everything tastes very fresh, everyone I have brought here loves it.","84829":"Wish I could give this place negative stars...\n\nThe food is over-priced and the quality is poor but what tops it all off\nis the rude staff...\n\nI came in thinking customer service is something every staff member should be proud to have.\n\nThe male employee behind the counter kept staring at me when I came in, as I ordered and when I sat down to eat.\n\nHe then pretended to clean a table near me only to use it as an excuse to come over and ask me if I had my cell phone on. He then said \"give it to me babe so I can add my digits to it\"\n\nNot only offensive but over the top rude.\n\nI got up and left. The owner needs to sit down with his under-trained staff and either fire them all or al least train them to be nice.\n\nNEVER going back again.","84914":"I love this place! The Meatball sandwich is great and so are all the pastas. Completely authentic and not gross like a cheapy Italian Restaurant.\nEverything is good from the bread, to the meatballs, to the side salad. Order the half portion or full portion of all their menu items and it will not disappoint. Expect to wait a 1\/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!","84923":"This place has gone downhill very fast. The food is not the question, the food is phenomenal. But if you want some of the worst customer service you've ever seen, than go to Defalcos. Employees are not friendly, staff will ignore you, and I've asked questions on multiple occasions and gotten blank stares. Today is probably my last time here","85771":"Such a great little shop with delicious sandwiches - fresh bread and flavorful meats.  Just tell them exactly what you want and they will make it to go or you can pull up a chair and eat inside.  The service is super friendly, and the grocery section is small, but inventive.","86993":"I don't think i have ever had a pleasant time at defalcos. The service is always horrible and the sandwiches always take forever. I gave defalcos plenty of chances before finally deciding that i will never return. The first time i ended up here i was with my sister and my boyfriend. We wanted a quality sandwich on a nice baguette bread. We got just that, don't get me wrong the food is really good, they just always make a mistake. I ask for no cheese, i'll get it... no onions... they're on there... no mayo... i get extra. Its never ending with this place. Two times i ordered to go. once i got a turkey sandwich with nothing in it besides turkey when i asked for LTO... the last time i went the guy gave me tuna instead. Its little mistakes that make this place a hassle to visit. We always have to wait atleast 30 minutes for our meal because they are always understaffed. If you are in a hurry for lunch i do NOT reccomend this place. If you have an hour to waste this is your place... but you might not always get what you order!","87690":"I have zero complaints. Defalcos is INCREDIBLE. Their food is great, everything is fresh.  The employees are such nice people. I love defalcos.  Its not cheap but you get good value here. Well worth it.","90438":"Defalco's is heaven. It's debatable whether I was more sad to move away from Scottsdale because of leaving my friends, or Defalco's.  \n\nI could honestly eat here every day of my life.  Their sub sandwiches are like a meat party in your mouth.  Their noodles are creamy and delicious.  All of their salads and antipasti are unreal. \n\nAlways a long line and it's kind of overwhelming inside but it is so so so worth the wait!","90546":"I have been eating at this place now for about 5 years. I love how they created more  room since before it was too small and crowded. The lunch time rush is not for those in a hurry. You can expect to wait after you place your order on a weekday about 15-30 minutes before  you leave if you are doing a take-out order. The place does get packed but the hot and cold sandwiches that I have tried are awesome and full of flavor. The pasta salad is ok but nothing to write home about. If you are not in a hurry and can wait up to 30 mins for your to go order it is worth a try. If not stop by after 2pm when the lunch rush has already passed through.","91538":"Amazing food. Lunch lines can get long so I generally call my order in if I plan on going around that time. I generally pick up a grinder if I'm looking for a lunchtime bite. I don't understand how or why people would spend their money at the local chains with this place around. Ive seen some of the same staff members there for over 5 years which tells me they treat their employees well. Always a fun and friendly atmosphere. They also play good music. If you havent been, check them out. I highly recommend this place to every local I discuss food with.","91908":"wow!  great italian grocery.  I am a fan of the steak sandwich with the pesto sauce upgrade :)\n\nnever had a sandwich with pesto in it... lets just say whenever i make a sandwich at home, i put pesto in it.\n\nBut to be honest they are a bit pricy for what they offer, but the food is good so it all works out.","91935":"This is by far the best Italian place I've ever eaten at!!  This is the 3rd time I've eaten here and it never dissapoints. You have to try the steak and cheese sandwich, stuffed shells, and the chicken pesto pasta is a must! I'd give it ten stars if I could.","92184":"had amazing fettuccine! so creamy and the chicken was breaded which made it even better","92198":"I stopped in to Defalco's grocery to grab a couple items before heading to a BYOB wine tasting. Grabbed some cheese, dessert, and some risotto and pasta to take home as well. I went in on a Friday about 3pm and this place is BUSY! The deli was busy, people in\/out, and it smelled freaking amazing. The food looked really good on the restaurant side and I will definitely be back there for some pizza and calzones. I can see why they have such amazing reviews. One thing I did wish they had was crackers (to have with the cheeses I just bought). They only carried bruschetta type bread, no crackers at all. The dessert case had some great stuff though. Nice shop.","92203":"LOVE this place. It is my \"go to\" deli and grocery store when I need that special Italian item I cannot get anywhere else. Italian wedding cookies, cannolis, pizzelles and coffees. Great selection of salads and pasta items in the deli.","93111":"This little local Italian Deli and Grocery store is awesome! We stopped in for some authentic Italian groceries. They have a wide variety of imported pastas, sauces, cookies, olive oils, vinegars and other oils. Cheeses and meats. We walked out with ingredients to make a super yummy lasagna. The deli here is stocked with pasta salads, sandwiches, and other Italian delicacies. The service here is top notch.\nTony was there when we were there, and my husband(who is half Italian) and Tony traded lasagna recipes. We will be back!","93953":"I'm torn.  My wife and I tried this place primarily because it was profiled on DDD.  We shared a pizza.  Thin crust (the way we like) and it was probably one of the tastiest pizzas we've ever had!\nBUT, when it arrived at our table it was BARELY lukewarm.  Had it been sitting around awhile before the server brought it to us?  Was it so busy in there that it took some time for the server to bring it to us?  I don't know.\nSorry, guys.  That's why I can't give you 5 stars.","94080":"Very authentic.  It's a ways away from where I live now but it's my go-to spot when I want to treat myself. It's reminiscent of some of the Italian eateries I grew up going to in the Boston area. Definitely give this place a try","94888":"The chicken fettuccini Alfredo is delicious! The old fashion spaghetti with meatball, also on point. This is one of those market\/deli\/restaurants that are worth the awkward set up. The chicken in the Alfredo is breaded. Even though that is not my preference and I wasn't expecting it, it was still some of the best Alfredo that I've ever had. In fact, the only restaurant that has an Alfredo that is worth going out for(since carussos in Gilbert closed down years and years ago, which had the best Chilean sea bass, that I've ever had, but that's a whole other story... miss them but feeling hopeful since finding this place). They put Parmesan cheese on the caeser salad, which makes the cheese factor farther than my preference but for you parm lovers, you have that to look forward to. \nThe dessert shelves look phenomenal but we are awfully full... so glad to have a new favorite Italian place. It's harder to do than I thought it would be so I'm super excited. \n\nUpdate: Already went back. So delicious. We tried the lasagne with meat sauce. Perfect balance of cheese and meattp sauce and noodles. And their tiramisu is moist and light. If you love food, do yourself a favor and go check this place out.","95105":"2\/27\/2107 - Tonite I ate lasag\u00f1a at DeFalco's and it was DELICIOUS!  Next time I'll take it to go, maybe heat up it more than they did. \n\nTall, like lasagna is supposed to be, wonderful Italian sausage. I haven't had lasagna this good in 10 years. In fact, writing this review now it occurs to me I'll go back there again tonight. \n\nWhat better recommendation can you give a restaurant than \"...I'm going to go back again and again\"?  \n\nDeFalco's occasionally has a misstep but I'm telling you this is a solid, solid pick!\nAnd great lasagna!\n\n3\/13\/2017 I've got good news and I've got bad news: the good news is, the lasagna is good here.  The bad news is, it's inconsistent.  The flavor has been entirely different each of the four times I've eaten the dish since 2\/27.  I would say that part of that has to be me, the difference in taste buds one day to the next, but Italian cooking is like that: it IS different in flavor day to day, especially when it's fresh...it's detonating.  Not their fault, but not mine either.","96357":"I've traversed the lands in search of a magical Philly. Every time I thought I was close to completing my quest, I was meet with an unsatisfying sandwich and had no choice but to trek forward. But not today. Today was different. Today I discovered DeFalco's. After many years, my quest has come to an end. They have possibly the best Philly I've ever had. Surely it must be be best in Phoenix at the very least.\n\nI was offered a sizeable chunk of my buddy's enormous calzone. It, too, did not disappoint. \n\nI shall return here one day. Though I fear now there is a hole in my heart that my quest for a grand Philly once occupied. It was my driving force; the wellspring from which I flowed. Perhaps one day, I shall find new reason to live.","96452":"My favorite Italian restaurant! Their  Italian sausage is made daily and is super fresh and delicious. The  Meatball sandwich is incredible! And all the pastas are made to perfection. I just recently discovered the pizza sub. Yum! \n\nReasonably priced, and a fun place to eat.\n\nBTW I think the diet Pepsi from the fountain is the best I've ever had.. I don't know why, but it just taste better.","96684":"Great place for fresh Italian Sandwich. Rolls are killer. The meat melts in your mouth. Also a great little Italian grocery store. Only place if the valley where I was able to find Stella Doro cookies (for you East Cost people).\n\nNothing fancy, but cut little place. I've always gone at off hours as I've been told it gets packed,... I can see that as they only have around 10 tables.","97041":"YUM!\n\nWife & I went the other day and it was probably 130pm on a Sat afternoon and it was certainly busy but you could get a table.  The menu is quite large and plenty of selections.  The food was good, the homemade sausage was really good, their sauce (gravy) is very tasty and a little the sweet side.  \n\nCount us in as fans for sure and nice to have a good Italian deli\/eatery to enjoy a meal.","97601":"Great food, good service, wonderful groceries! Pure Italian!","97671":"Authentic, delicious, accommodating are just a few worlds to describe this Italian gem.you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The pizza is made perfectly as the crust is not too crisp or soft. The lasagna and cannolis are must have, too.","97761":"Really cool how they have tables thru out the store area - lots of great specialty foods and bread is great. Had a turkey and Swiss sub to go. Bread was excellent, turkey fresh, lettuce fine cut. Nice selection of ice tea. I will definitely stop in again and try other menu items.","98020":"Meatball sandwich, rock solid! Don't hesitate, eat it, it's tasty. Chicken Parm sandwich was also pleasant, cleaner than most chicken parm, it's lightly breaded and I assume it can't be fried, so I assume it's baked. It's very tender and not greasy.","98246":"If you are looking for quick, great food at a reasonable price, Defalco's will not disappoint. The sandwiches are fresh, the pastas are tasty, and the people are great. If you are in the Scottsdale area and looking for Italian food, Defalco's is a must.","98970":"My new favorite place to get Italian food. It reminds me of when we lived in Philadelphia.  The Centurion Calzone was awesome.  The deserts are close to the quality in Italy.   I am definitely coming back to Defalco's.","100086":"Wow! Really good Italian food with a grocery store attached. Wish they were closer to where i live.","101755":"(Lyrics - Falco - Rock Me Amadeus)\n\nOoh, Rock me Defalcos!\nOoh, Rock me Defalcos!\n\nOoh!\nOoh!\n\nPa-pa-pa-pa-pastrami, feed me!\nPastrami, pastrami, feed me!\n\nPa-pa-pa-pa-pastrami, feed me!\nPastrami, pastrami, feed me!\n\nSa-sa-sa-sa-salad, soups....feed me!\nSa-sa-sa-sa-salad, soups\n\nDefalco's Italian Grocery is my new favorite Italian deli sandwich shop. Literally it's a shop! You can purchase your deli meats, olive oils, and wine here! The wine selection is quite large and the deli meats are from the best -- Boar's Head of course!\n\nMy first order at Defalco's and I went for a Pastrami sandwich with a side salad. The Pastrami was delightful as I ordered it on a baguette bread. Perfect crunch to a perfect cured meat -- Uh! The side salad was just an extra for me, but to me chagrin, it rocked my palates! The Italian dressing that came along with it was homemade! Nobody around town I now does this and I don't understand why!? A must have especially when you swing by Defalco's.\n\nService came with a smile as you would need to order in line. The place is setup like an old school grocery store; as if you stepped back into time! - Enjoy!","102164":"The omnipresent crowds here speak volumes about the quality of their food. \n\nThere is a bit of chaos in the ordering and food delivery process simply because so much of the space is taken up by the tables scattered in amongst the store shelves. \n\nThe food is delicious, the portions huge, the prices reasonable.\n\nJust a warning for people that \"eat with their eyes\" first. My last visit I ordered a chicken philly cheese steak which had to be one of the more revolting looking things that I have eaten in a very long while. The chicken is ground, not in chunks, and when mixed with the mushrooms, cheese, peppers and onions resembles either vomit or dog food. Good thing I have a strong constitution and it tasted nothing like the aforementioned.","102256":"I had a bruschetta open face sandwich basically all it was was ham A ham sandwich had  maybe one little piece of tomato on each slice.was hard pressed to find  any mozzarella on it.  We also had a Portabella mushroom sandwich was way too much bread.. it really looks like a fun place to eat just wish it was better I will try one more time maybe it was just an off day.","102840":"BEST CHEESE-STEAK IN ARIZONA.  BEST MEATBALL SUBS IN THE WEST.\nI am from New Jersey and have eaten all up and down the east coast.  this place is a real jewel, only authentic italian deli i have found here in arizona. Try the cheesesteak on the italian baguette (crispy outside soft inside)  Pasta, deli you can't go wrong here.\n\n It's important to understand that everything is home made and takes time.  more than you may think approx 15-20 minutes for most orders. CALL YOUR EAT IN ORDER AHEAD OF TIME- then you will love coming here often.  \nthey sell limited quantities of pizza dough daily to make at home.  it's amazing and cheap!","103043":"A total place warp to New Jersey or Long Island. The family couldn't be nicer. Terrific sandwiches (fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil and lots of others), a nice selection of unusual-for-this-area groceries, and it's even fun to sit around outside at the strip mall and eat during the afternoon.","103079":"Unbelievable place. You'd never guess looking from the outside how great the food is. Forget paying crazy prices and just get maybe the best Italian in greater Phoenix area. \n\nRead the reviews and just stop in.","103169":"Stopped in today for a late lunch.  It's nice to get here after the lunch crowd has come and gone.  The meatball sandwich on a soft roll was over the top.  Great big meatballs, good flavor and plenty of sauce.  Highly recommended!","103226":"So.......I love Defalco's. My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto. I've had someone describe their service to me as \"New York style\" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else. The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible. Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too. I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food.","103437":"Wanted to try after seeing Guy Feiri review on DDD's. I live in Kansas City so it's a haul. Luckily, I have family in Tempe. 1\/2 Sammie was plenty for me, the sandwiches are huge! My party ordered a bit of everything and everyone was happy! Will be back!","103741":"Ahhmazing cheesesteak. Was a bit of a wait but pretty much worth it. Loved the wine selection and other grocery goodies!","103885":"Ahhh...a taste of home! An Italian from Jersey, now in AZ, Kong's for what besides a great pizza...good old fashion Italian food...and I found it! Home made fennel sausage, cannoli, cavateli, fresh bread and sooo much more! \n\nLooking to make Sunday dinner? Start your gravy here with canned plum tomatoes, a nice red wine, and most everything else you need :-)\n\nThank you DelFalcos for keeping it authentic...you guys do it right!","104002":"I can basically eat here everyday. They have so many good things ion the menu I will never get through it","104599":"I had the cheesesteak sub my husband had the chicken Parmesan sub. Both were delicious but mine tasted better. Portion size: We each ordered the small one so we could save room for dessert. The sandwich covered most of a normal sized dinner plate and we had to take dessert with us.","104632":"Very cool little find. Has been in the valley for years, but not until recently did i wonder in. To my delight not only do they serve food, but there is a shopping section for me to choose items to cook at home. Hard to find pastas and unique wine. Line however was really long,but that's all.","105356":"This place oozes Italian with its meat and cheeses on display. I've never actually come here for Groceries, I always come for dinner and sometimes lunch. Most things here are pretty tasty but the I always come back to the pasta. It is very good with my favorite being the Gnocci w\/ Alfredo sauce.","105866":"I have been coming here for about 13 years and in the last year things have really gone downhill here. It is sad we all have been going here forever it seems something had drastically changed in the quality of food. I threw half of my meal away last week it was so horrible. I guess all great things come to an end. No more Italians in the Italian restaurant. Sad but true.","106876":"I gave DeFalco's another shot. At the end of this review, you will see the huge redeeming factor, and why this business has created a fan in me!\n\nMy dinner companion and I came in last night and we shared a plate of Gnocchi (with red sauce and alfredo, both on the side), as well as a Caprese Salad. We took home a chocolate cannoli.\n\nWe patiently waited for our meal, and we able to share a great conversation about some of the wonderful in the store like the different pastas, olive oils and such.\n\nWhen our food arrived, we were treated to all kinds of good stuff! The Gnocchi was cooked to perfection. Not gummy, not tough...just perfect like little pillows of magic! The sauces were delightful! The alfredo is very rich and tasty. You can taste all the different ingredients in it. The garlic, the cheese, the cream. It's not the Olive Garden. It's legit! \n\nThe marinara wasn't overly tangy or tomatoey. It was just right!\n\nThe Caprese Salad was perfect as well! The mozzarella danced on our palates and the tomatoes were divine. I would've liked a little bit more basil, but maybe that's something I can ask for next time :)\n\nThe portions are VERY generous. We were unable to finish the Gnocchi. You'll see why in a second.\n\nRegarding my past review...The staff was much friendlier this time around. I am VERY happy that I gave these guys a second chance. Maybe I caught someone on a bad day. Things happen. \n\nAlthough there was a wait, we ordered before a few people because we were deciding on what to order. That's ok.  It was worth the wait. Take in the atmosphere, look around the store. Relax. Have a conversation with the person you are with. You'll forget about the wait. Don't be in a rush.\n\nAlso this time around, I was able to speak to Anthony DeFalco the owner, and talk to him about my first experience. He is a VERY nice guy, and very passionate about the business. My advice to any Yelper or customer who has ever had an experience that is out of the ordinary (most of the reviews are very positive), come in and tell him and he will make sure the staff fixes the problem for next time.\n\nI should also mention that he saw me, and recognized me, and made sure that my table had a sandwich in addition to our meal that my dinner companion and I shared. It was PERFECT. Bread heavenly with a crispy crust, just enough mayo and mustard, delicious cheese, and tasty meats. \n\nI am a fan.\n\nHe then explained to me about his selection of ingredients, breads, olive oils etc. You can see the passion he brings to work each day. It's pretty cool. I don't usually update reviews from bad experiences, but this is one I am very glad I did.\n\nGreat job Anthony and the staff at DeFalco's!\n\nP.S. We took the chocolate cannoli home. And it was epic.","107400":"Cute Italian Deli!  Our wait to order in line was about 15 mins.\nIf I came again I would order the meatballs. My husbands spaghetti and meatballs was worth the wait!","107639":"A great place to go for huge portions of Italian! We were there on a weekend night. The quaintness of sitting between the aisles is pretty interesting. I got a whole-size order of fettuccine alfredo, which came with a side salad and garlic bread. The garlic bread was so-so, but the fettuccine alfredo had generous heaps of sauce, chicken with a fried breading, and the salad was made with fresh ingredients. There was so much that I couldn't eat it all. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to order at the counter, and it's a long wait, especially since we got stuck behind some indecisive people who were standing in front of the register staring at the menu for fifteen minutes.","107770":"Good as long as you know how to order correctly! For example the sandwiches are good, the pizza, not so much. The spaghetti and meatballs came with ONE meatball...so not great...but the cannoli is good.  So anyways, has potential, but the menu is just too big. It's impossible to be great with so many options.","108040":"Some of the best Italian I've had in Phoenix! Chicken parm sandwich is to die for, and I always have left overs. \n\nI will definitely be back!!!!","108054":"You can't go wrong here at all. Everything is so delicious. Just try some of their sandwiches with freshly sliced meat and you will realize what you have been missing out on your whole life from other sandwich shops. The pasta: delicious. The pastries?! Fuhgeddabowd it! Not much to not like here (location is kind of in a crappy area but who cares too much when the food is this tasty) There is a bit of a crowd during the lunch hour, but you would be hard pressed to find a better italian market like this in south scottsdale. Try it at least once folks.","108473":"We have lived less than 2 minutes from Defalcos for 15 years and it has never disappointed! My favorite dish in the EggPlant Parm, which is to die for! Thank you Defalcos for always being our go to restaurant!","109032":"Awesome subs.  Although it can be quite busy during lunch time if you order ahead it's all good.  I especially love their imported goods and I can't get enough of the eggplant parm!","109132":"We have dined her several times (10) and I keep forgetting to write a review!  Delicious beef cheese steak sandwich.  We ordered the caprese salad today. The mozzarella was outstanding!  Served on a bed of romaine lettuce \/ tomatoes.  We also ordered a side of meatballs.  Amazing!  Just like my Nana used to make.  They held together well, but were still tender and full of flavor.  The red sauce was delicious.  Rich with flavor...  \nCasual environment, you order at the counter and they deliver your food to your table. \nThey also have a small store area where you can buy top of the line pasta noodles, tomato sauce, wines etc... Wonderful deli with delicious food!","109624":"Went there with my daughter and granddaughter today for the first time.  Read the reviews on Yelp and we were in the area, so we had to try it.  It is a busy little place.  Has a lot to offer for groceries and a large selection for their menu.  I had read about the Cheesesteak so I had to try it (Beef).  While its not like the Philly Cheesesteaks you get at Pat's Steak or Geno's Steak in Philadelphia, it was a close second.  Very testy.  My daughter had the Italian Combo and it was delicious.  We will be back and next time we will bring more family and friends.  Great job!!!!","109722":"This is as authentic as it gets for Italian grocery. The family is very friendly and the service is fast. I recommend buying\/stocking up on olives and going with the Italian Combo sandwich on sourdough. Writing about it makes me want to go back!","110039":"I agree with a fellow yelper that the quality has gone down slightly in the past few years. Coming from a family of European immigrants, I would also agree that their bread needs work. Other than that, the sandwiches and salads are delicious and I will continue returning! Don't come here if you're on a diet. :)","110162":"Up until yesterday, I was planning on completing my draft of an effusive, glowing, 5-star review for Defalco's.  Yes, it was going to be a wonderful description of how much I love the food, blah, blah, blah...\n\nThat was until I waited 35 minutes for a cheesesteak.  35 minutes.  For a sandwich.  \n\nNo, it wasn't during the lunch rush.  In fact, there were only 4 other people in the store.  I walked right up to the counter to order, as there was not a line (a first!).  And then proceeded to wait.  And wait.  And wait some more.  35 minutes, to be exact, thanks to the time-stamp on my receipt.\n\nI have been to Defalco's on more occasions than I can count, and know to expect a longer than average wait.  Hey, quality takes time.  I get it.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every item I have tried there - pizza, calzone, cold sandwiches, deli items and of course my personal favorite, the cheesesteak.  My partner in culinary crime counts their food, especially their four-meat combo sandwich, among his favorite things.  \n\nUnfortunately, 35 minutes for one sandwich in a practically empty place is ridiculous enough to make me re-think my formerly 5-star opinion.","110171":"Where every cheat meal should come to enjoy in the amazing that is Defalco's. It's just THAT good. Come with an appetite, and if you are a wine drinker, take advantage of their selection!","110540":"I've been here a few times and always been so impressed but keep forgetting to make a review. I feel like I say this in all my reviews lately but I'm pregnant and so really when I'm craving something, it's so specific and I end up building it up to be the best thing in the whole world and then when I get it I'm disappointed because my expectations were way unreasonable. Well today for lunch, I wanted Italian beef. I've had the cold Italian combo sandwich here before and a few other subs and they were always great. The artichoke salad is really good too. \n\nI ordered over the phone to avoid the lines... half Italian beef sub with provolone, and a side of Giardinara peppers. I went to pick it up and it was ready right away, and for everything it was only around $7. I read in another review that they don't dip the whole sub, and I like mine really juicy, but I figured I'd still try it. Well they provide a side of au jus so you can dip it yourself, so that was exciting. I got back to work and started eating... omg, it really was so so good. With each bite it tasted better and better. The hot peppers I got on the side made the sub though (I think that's what I was truly craving all along). It was hot and juicy and the au jus was more than enough. There was a lot of meat, which was tender and perfectly cut, not a singly fatty piece and it was all evenly distributed on the sub. Sometimes I have to rearrange my sandwich to even out the meat but this was perfect. It was so good. I was really full by the time I finished but still wished I had ordered a full. The only negative thing I would say is there were too many onions and green peppers for my taste. However, I'm not mad about that because I'd rather there be too many and I can pick some off rather than not have enough and wish there were more. \n\nThe guy that always takes my phone orders is seriously the nicest guy ever. (I think his name is Joe?) He's so pleasant on the phone and just as nice in person. He'll give you his personal recommendation if you have questions and he'll help you make decisions if you're super indecisive like I am. I love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone. They have such a wide menu that there's really something for everyone!","110662":"I love this place! Authentic Italian food in the middle of an Italian grocery store- good for eating in or to go.","110937":"Best Italian restaurant ever! Worth the wait!!!!!!!!! Wait isn't that bad prepare for a good meal!","111156":"I used to come here all the time, when I lived in Scottsdale.  I've since moved (5 years ago) and am back this week for a visit. I was super excited to come to \"my favorite authentic Italian deli\" .... and I was a bit disappointed.  The front counter person was extremely rude and dismissive while I was trying to order .... and they were not even busy!  I'm not sure if it was an \"off day\", but I'm assuming not after reading other reviews with similar complaints of customer service! It's quite sad, really, as they used to be super pleasant.  I was trying to eek out a score of 4 (down a star for bad customer service), but then I got my food.  The wait was not long but, unfortunately, my Italian combo sandwich was not as awesome as it was in the past! It was lacking in flavor, as well as the pasta salad I ordered on the side.  .... so I have to dock another star! .... should have docked two stars, but didn't want to leave DeFalco's with a 2-Star rating .   The grocery store portion\/selection of food to purchase and prepare at home is awesome (there... there is 1 star back!). It was very clean and well organized.  \nDEFALCO'S .... train your staff to be more pleasant (at least the counter people who \"greet\" you .... geesh .... and people MAY get over the slip in taste. \n\nBooooooo, I probably won't \"intentionally\" be back during future visits to Phoenix!","111422":"Quality of food was excellent! Will be back again to try pasta. Italian sandwich was one of the best. I was worried that the wife order the wrong thing, ( Ruben) but it was delicious. We had the macaroon and pre made cannoli, which I am always afraid of. But both were fresh and delictable. Can wait to go back. Guy you be right!","112104":"I only go here for the fresh salads. The macaroni, chicken Caesar and seafood pasta salad are all excellent. I find the marinara sauce on the pasta to be very bland and the sandwiches take forever to be made. I shouldn't have to sit at a table to wait for a sandwich in a DELI. But like I said I love the salads","113423":"Coming from New York, it's great to find something like this in Arizona. It did take forever to get the food, but I had fun browsing the food and wine on the shelves and the food was worth the wait. I highly recommend the stuffed shells! I look forward to going back.","114029":"the best italian deli ever!!!!!!!!!  outstanding pastas' like lasagne, great raviolis'. sub sandwhichs' that are amazing. great pizza and also great desserts like great cannolis' and lemon bars.","114586":"WOW!! This place has solid Italian food! you can eat there or get it to go but either way you're making a great move by eating here! I had the chicken pesto and it was amazing! they also have a great wine selection!","115604":"Maybe they make good sandwiches but if you order something harder than that you might NOT get something OK to eat .\n\nNot only did I wait 1\/2 hour to get my salad after I ordered it but when it arrivered it was awful and mostly not edible.\n\nI ordered the chicken pesto salad and it was smeared maybe bottleld pesto paste smeared sickenly thick on top of breaded chicken breast ....(AWFUL)\n\nthe salad could have been great but it wasn't because it was soaked in a fishy Oil that tasted like oil from anchovies it was a bowl of salad drowning in what tasted like oil from anchovies and covered with lots of grated cheese to make the fishy oil all over taste even worse .\n\nAlso a big splash of tomato sauce on my salad plate .\n\nThis salad was insaulting and disrespectal to anyone .\n\nThis truley was one of the worst meals I ever tried to eat .\n\nI left my salad in full display of guest to see\n\nI didn't even complain because I didn't trust them to make me anythingelse and I didn't want to wait another half hour .\n\nI think even a teen at a drive threw would care and make better food I can never try this place again....no care here....I can't eat at a place that is this way .","116475":"Defalco's is a yummy institution in Tempe\/Scottsdale whose sandwiches, Italian dinners and desserts leave their patrons stuffed like a cannoli. Great for the entire family though seating is a premium.","116895":"I couldn't find an Italian in the place.\nThe food is 100% canned garbage.\nThey serve there meatball sub on a hotdog bun.\nThe customers are sheep.They would eat anything you feed them.\nMake sure you have your toilet paper very ,very close....\nYUCK!!!","117410":"I vowed never to return after my last experience here but was in the area and we were in need of hot cherry peppers and thought Defalco's would have them.\n\nI had the half Italian beef sandwich, I liked the taste of it with the onions and peppers on the crusty hard to find good bread. This half sandwich was big and sloppy and I felt like a pig woman eating it. They give you a tiny cup of au jus with it and a pepperoncini.\n\nMy husband had the Italian meat sandwich also on crusty bread and upgraded the cheese to the sharp provolone (.75 extra) and added roasted red peppers (1.50 extra)\n\nThey do sell hard to find Italian meats,and boar's head meats,cheeses,oils,vinegars,candy and pasta in shapes you can't find in your local grocery and many other things but not the whole (red) hot cherry peppers in vinegar that we were hoping to buy.\n\nThe sandwiches were good and overall maybe 4 stars but I still feel it is necessary to remove one star for the salad they made me last time.\n\n3-8-12 just tried the hot cherry pepper spread....BAH not hot or satisfying one bit","118263":"This is a dandy little Italian deli * grocery that's highly satisfying and interesting! They have great soups, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, and other delicious things. \n\nOrders are taken at a counter and piping hot food comes to the table in a rush in mouth-watering fashion. Tables are available indoors and outdoors, with grocery shelves loaded with many Italian food treasures. \n\nLocals and travelers go to DeFalco's, and deservedly so. This place is a gem, not to be missed on a trip to Scottsdale.","119779":"I say it over and over.. Go where the locals go and there is no chain of restaurants.. This place has been bookmarked for while for me and I glad it was on my way home today. I was literally across the street at the goodwill dropping off some donations and I looked up saw this place. As I driving up I saw three cars pulling up and three more cars leaving with to go orders. I knew I was right spot! \n\nI walked in to grocery\/restaurant with deli counter with plenty of seating throughout. I quickly grabbed a menu and browsed for bite to go! I was amazed by all of the selections on the menu with half options for many of pastas and sandwiches. \n\nI walked out with chicken parmigiana sandwich w\/ Greek side salad and strawberry cheesecake! I must admit I as expecting homemade sauce and authentic taste and they knocked it OUT THE PARK! \n\nMy sandwich was very delicious with homemade tomato sauce and juicy chicken with melted cheese! \n\nStrawberry cheesecake... Better than Cheesecake Factory! Very delicious \n\nI will be back","120382":"Since arriving in Scottsdale in July 2013, I have been to DeFalco's many times including last night. Everything is always great. The hoagies are truly Jersey\/Philly worthy. We tried chicken marsala last night - very tasty and great portion size. We also got two slices of strawberry swirl cheesecake to eat at home - very yummy. The place isn't too fancy but that's the appeal. I feel like I am back in my hometown deli in South Jersey.","121027":"Defalco's is my go-to Italian place in my neighborhood when I'm looking for something to-go or one of their giant sandwiches; there's a reason they offer a half order on their sandwiches!\n\nDefalco's can get pretty busy during lunch time so if you're looking to get food quickly, I'd suggest ordering ahead. If you order in the restaurant, it can take some time so be patient, that's the just magical workings of Defalco's. They have a very friendly and helpful staff!!\n\nMy favorite sandwich is their egg salad sandwich. I also had their chicken salad sandwich recently and it's just as delicious!! My boyfriend loves their meatball sub and philly cheesesteak. Some other notable sandwiches are their Italian sandwiches (duh! makes sense!)\n\nI've also had their gnochhi and garlic bread, yum and yum. You really can't go wrong with any of their menu items. They have a little Italian market before the register in case you're looking for something Italian specific! Defalco's has been around for quite some time now and there's a reason for it, it's awesome!","121284":"Not that Defalco's needs any more help, but I absolutely love it. This is my ideal Italian restaurant, great food, authentic experience, but not uppity. I always go back every time I'm in the area. \n\nAnd by the way, the cheesecake is the best I've ever had.","121306":"Philly cheesesteak is the best I've had on the western side of the country. Enough said. \n\nMeatball is home style sauce, good bread, good size meatballs and yummy.","121427":"Authentically quaint Italian grocery spot in the south side of Scottsdale. Great meat and cheese selection, With killer pizza.","121519":"First visit but not the last.  Enjoyed the Italian Combo which was a large sandwich so I had half for lunch and the other half for dinner.  So would recommend the half sandwich for one or split a whole.  Had heard this place had a good following and that it did with a continuous line of take out and dine in customers.","121831":"I really enjoy DeFalco's because of its unique atmosphere and the exceptional, authentic Italian food.  \n\nDeFalco's is a family-owned Italian deli and market.  The restaurant is divided by racks of wine, imported pasta and a large inventory of desserts and treats. After ordering at the back of the restaurant by the meat and cheese cases you're free to choose a table; no matter where you choose to sit, that spot in the house becomes your own private restaurant.\n\nYes, it does take a little bit longer to receive your meal but this is because they take the time to make every dish to order (the sign on the door even indicates this). Whatever you order comes out in its glorious perfection.  And, you get some extra time to stroll around the store as your mind wanders; so many items to choose from, so many meal ideas!  \n\nMy dinner companion and I split a Caprese salad, a full order of Gnocci with Alfredo and red sauces on the side, an Italian sandwich, and a chocolate cannoli for dessert. \n\nThe Caprese: the tomatoes were perfectly ripe, the mozzarella was exquisite (and it was a generous portion!), and the basil was refreshing.  The salad came with a side of olive oil--this olive oil was some of the best I've ever had--and balsamic vinegar.  \n\nThe Gnocci was incredibly light and slightly chewy; again, another incredibly delicious dish!  The side of red sauce and Alfredo were perfect--I like to go back and forth between dipping in each of them to create sort of a Vodka sauce.  The Alfredo was rich and had a strong garlic flavor, something very unique and quite addicting.  \n\nWe had to try an Italian sub; after all, the huge list of sandwiches, both hot and cold, was practically calling our names.  The bread had just the right amount of crunch, but it was also chewy and soft in the inside.  I was going to hold myself back from eating the entire thing, but I couldn't.  So damn good.  \n\nAND the cannoli!  We chose the chocolate covered variety.  The cream had just the right density and ratio of chocolate chips.  The shell itself was crisp and the chocolate added just enough richness to the dessert.  Incredible.  \n\nAnthony DeFalco came to our table to see how we enjoyed our meal, which really completed the whole experience.  He's incredibly passionate about his family's restaurant and explained how they never cut corners on quality ingredients.  We asked about the amazing olive oil that accompanied our Caprese salad, and he went to the back to bring out a bottle wrapped in gold foil.  I only wish I knew where to buy this exceptionally light and pure oil, but then again, that is DeFalco's secret.","122103":"As you can tell by all the other reviews, the food is good and at times great.  The service makes you want to walk out, while waiting for your food.  I went just this past week and waited for about twenty minutes while being two of ten people who were there.  It is ridiculous.  Everytime I go, I always say I'm going to call my order ahead next time, so that I do not have to wait .  The dining area itself is a mess, and it can be a little intrusive if someone is market shopping in front of your table.  As many negatives this place has I always go back.  If your in the mood for a good sammy lunch, this is the place in old town.","122441":"The food here is excellent. We ordered a sausage and beef sandwich and vodka pasta and they both tasted great! The service is fast considering the fact that it was lunch time and busy. It does not have the typical restaurant feel since it is also a grocery and a deli but don't be discouraged. Larger groups are probably hard to sit but if there's just two to three people then there are plenty of spaces for everyone. I will definitely come back again for the food.","122812":"This is a unique and special place. The moment you walk in the door you feel like you have been transported to Italy!   The smell, the feel, the look, the food, and the staff, it all takes you there. There is a walk up counter with a huge menu on the wall. You place your order here. There are so many options, including salads, beer or wine (by bottle or glass) and deserts There are tables scattered inside or on the patio with misters to beat the heat. They sell Italian groceries, meats, gelato, uncooked or precooked pasta, wine, cookies, sauces. It is usually busy and the staff is friendly. A fun place for a meal and easy to spend time browsing. I never leave empty handed.","123330":"Being from Boston, italian food is a necessity. This is the first authentic grocer \/ deli that delivers absolutely delicious food & generous portions. Absolutely recommend the calzones!","123586":"I have eaten here umpteen times, and have loved every sandwich, pasta, and salad I've had!","123789":"Its amazing! little place best cheesesteaks! you have to try it!","124268":"Hearty sauce made my cheese ravioli dish simply wonderful.  This really is an ethnic-style grocery store that just happens to have a few seats inside and out.  Lots of sauces, breads, and premium cheeses to choose from, and prices were comparable to what I pay for the same cheese at AJ's.  Garlicy\/buttery breadstick was just alright.\n\nGiven the limited seating I would only come here during off-peak dining hours.  Also, it took awhile for my entree and there were no orders ahead of me (quiet Sunday afternoon).","124449":"Wow, outstanding.\n\nHad the eggplant parm sandwich - (half - it was a HUGE half), and it was SO delicious.  The cheese was melted just perfectly.\n\nMy boyfriend had the Il Purista - w\/o the meat since I'm a vegetarian so we could share - so fresh and so tasty.\n\nWe also shared the artichoke salad, and gorgonzola stuffed green olives. .... Amazing.\n\nI can't wait to go back - like, maybe for a second lunch in 30 minutes.","124744":"i'm really torn about this review.  until about a month ago, i would have given 5 stars.  my husband and i have been going here since we were dating, and he was a frequent customer before that.  i fell in love with the eggplant parm sandwich and the selection of breads.  then i discovered the portabello sandwich, and began a torrid affair forsaking my eggplant parm.  my husband started ordering the chef salad and it looked so good that even though i think $10 is a ridiculous price for iceberg lettuce and cold cuts, i gave it a shot.  it was delicious!  they used actual cheddar cheese and there was so much salad!  the employees were pretty indifferent but they weren't rude.\n\nthen about a month or so ago we noticed a change.  we usually call our orders in and pick them up.  it's never been a problem before but recently the guy that works the pickup counter seems to have a bit of an attitude.  he seems to feel that customers are an interruption to whatever else he is doing and he has no problem making comments (not directly to customers of course) to that effect.  he will even right out ignore customers if he is doing something else like slicing meat.  because looking up and saying, \"i'll be with you in a minute\" would just be asking too much.  four times we've gone to pick up orders, and four times we've come home and debated ever returning.\n\nnow the food... as i mentioned $10 for a plain jane chef salad.  but it tastes good and there's a lot of it... or there was until tonight.  our salads were considerably small, there were fewer meat \"wheels\" and those were smaller made with less meat, less tomato and cucumber, and the orange cheese did not feel or taste like real cheddar.  american?  yuck.  overall the salad had a \"funny\" taste like it came from a bag and hadn't been properly rinsed before being served.  my husband couldn't even finish his and tossed it.","125925":"We live right downtown the street, and I'm so glad that we do! Their pizza, calzones, and desserts are all amazing, and the service never disappoints. It can get a little crowded because of the grocery shelving and displays, but the food makes up for it.","126502":"Defalco's is my go-to lunch spot, and one of my favorite places in the area! Everything I've tried (which is about half the menu) is delicious, and the store is full of great Italian goods. Highly recommend the beef cheesesteak and chicken pesto sandwich!\n\nSomething to keep in mind, however, is that there is not a lot of room to eat at the restaurant, and the place is generally packed (especially around lunch), so it's often a good idea to call ahead and take your order to go.\n\nI know others on Yelp have complained about the service, but to be honest, the service reminds me of the service I used to receive at similar places all over New Jersey, and I really don't mind it. This place is always busy, so it doesn't bother me if the staff isn't the nicest I've ever met. That said, they've also never been rude to me either. They're just busy and moving fast -- the food is amazing and very reasonably priced, so that's what matters to me at a place like Defalco's.","127368":"The food is absolutely delicious and authentically Italian! Good sized portions.  The staff is not as friendly as they could be but the food makes up for it; thus the 5 stars.","127712":"I know, its annoying to all you AZ peeps when I say, \"I grew up in NY with good food.\" I accept that it is impossible for you to understand what it is like to rarely have bad bread, bad cold cuts, bad service or just plain have a place that isn't trying staying around. Of course, us east coaster's are leaving out all the corporate places; the same Chili's, Applebees, Boston Market...etc stores are back east as well (most of them) and they suck just as bad there as they do here. What we mean is that the places that everyone goes to in our old neighborhoods are like Defalco's. \n\nDefalco's is like no other place I have been to here in AZ. They have amazing food, great bread, Boar's Head cold cuts, and italian groceries that I didn't even realize I couldn't find until I saw them here. Amazing...just amazing. \n\nThey have chicken cutlets. NO ONE IN AZ HAS THESE! It is kind of ridiculous that an easy to make, menu staple (in the east) is impossible to find out here. I have seen them on menus, they were actually chicken tenders. Cutlets are chicken breast, breaded with Italian spices and egg, pan-fried and then baked. Defalco's has awesome cutlets! They use them on their Chicken Parmesan sandwich as well. That blew me away! \n\nThey also have Dilusso Genoa Salami, if you haven't had it...you haven't had salami! This gem of a store is a constant stop when I am anywhere near it, or have family visiting. If you haven't been...just go!\n\nSide note: If you are expecting to be told what is on the sandwich, give up eating sandwiches. When you order, tell them the things you enjoy eating on bread, they'll assemble it, bring it to you and then you eat it. It ain't Quiznos or Subway, this is good food. If you can't figure it out, walk away and eat crap, come back when you know what you like!","127933":"We used Defalco's catering for my mom's 75th birthday celebration.  We worked with Robert to plan the event.  He gave suggestions, and kept telling me \"you are ordering too much food.\" He was right...we had too much food but that was o.k. because everything was delicious and this gave us an opportunity to have left overs. I did think it was very kind of him to say you are ordering too much when other restaurants would have not mentioned it and been happy to have a bigger order. Robert was placing the customers need as the top priority.\n\nOur guests ranted and raved about the food and of course the cannolis.  Everything was hot, fresh and delicious!!!! I couldn't have been happier and the cost was extremely reasonable to feed 60 people.  Highly encourage you to try their Italian grocery for dine in or carry out.\n\nThanks Robert and staff for making our party a huge success!","127961":"I am not a fan of chicken (I know, weird), but Defalco's has one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life- the chicken cheesesteak sandwich is to die for! I was shocked at how much I loved it. It is extra cheesy and the bread is incredible! Do yourself a favor and order it asap.","128348":"We ordered a small chicken pesto chicken which was 12\". However more than enough for 2-4 people with nothing additionally! We enjoyed the cute shop and restaurant duo as the ambiance. The service was great as well! We paid around $20 for a drink, pizza, and some marinara on the side.\n\nThey had a cute shop with a good variety- with many authentic looking items.","129292":"I've never been to a real authentic Italian bakery before but I am so glad this was my first experience, the staff is amazing, the manager was so hospitable and so genuinely sweet. He came by our table to see how the food was and talked with us for a while. Overall, He made my experience here so fantastic. The chocolate mouse cake is to die for.  Definately coming back. Thank you for such a great meal!","129714":"Delicious and great service! Tried for the first time last night and was not disappointed! Split a Chicken Pesto Sandwich and The Il purista Sandwich with my S.O. and both were amazing. I can't wait to explore the rest of their menu and plan on going back to check out their wine selection and and grocery.","131222":"This place is the best.  My go to is the Il Purista and the Tuna Pasta Salad, so good!","131904":"I'm from New England, and this place brought me home.  i had the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and olive oil sandwich, and I added prosciutto and had it on foccacia and it was absolutely perfect.  I went there yesterday and it's 10 in the morning and I'm ready to go back.  Other hot entrees and sandwiches passed by that looked incredible, and hearty.  This place serves real Italian food and creates an atmosphere that takes you back east.  Another Arizona gem :)","132012":"I love this place! kind of weird to stand in a LONG, and I mean at lunch time it can be very LONG line that snakes through a grocery store, and then eat in the aisles, but you get used to it and then fall in love with the idea.","133120":"Had a great dinner tonight.   This was our first visit and the clerk was helpful with suggestions when we ordered.   Gnocchi was light and airy, cheesesteak sandwich and Greek salad were delicious and the cheese ravioli was very tasty.\n\nWill definitely return!","133219":"The sandwiches here are so good. My reasoning for the 5 - stars though, is the actual store inside. Quality of meats are great and the amount of traditional Italian items to purchase is so great. One of the best Italian markets in all of the metropolitan area.","134659":"If you're craving some good italian deli food, this is the best around. It's got an extensive menu from pizzas to deli sandwiches. It also has Italian groceries where u can pick up some great quality meats. I always order their hot sandwiches  like the meatball or Philly cheese steak. The portions and price are just right at about 6\" and $5. The only knock I have is the wait time can be a bit long if you can't afford a long lunch at work.","134730":"My fiance and two of our friends went to Defalco's for dinner tonight. I ordered the Meat Lasagna (half portion) which came with garlic bread and let me tell you..it was quite possibly the best lasagna I have ever had! The sauce was fantastic, perfectly seasoned. My fiance ordered the Pesto chicken sandwich, which I sampled. The bread was wonderful,chewy and slightly toasted, not like those terrible deflated buns at most sub shops, that they somehow manage to make shatter due to over toasting when bitten into. The bread itself was amazing here, coupled with juicy chicken and an almost floral fragrant pesto. Worth every bite! \n\nOur friends ordered the Vegetarian lasagna and Pasta Alfredo. The Alfredo was buttery but needed pepper, which was fine since a lot of people don't like pepper and there were salt and pepper shakers at each table so the customer could decide if they wanted it or not. I didn't have a chance to sample the veggie lasagna, but by the pace at which it was eaten I assumed it was very good. All our orders came with a side of garlic bread that was absolutely fabulous, I would come back here just for the garlic bread. \n\nThis place is also a grocery store and so I couldn't resist but buy a jar of Puttanesca sauce and an order of tiramisu to go (which is sitting in my fridge as I type this), which I must say, sounds like a marvelous breakfast. Overall I really recommend Defalco's, they have an extensive array of wines, cheeses, meats, pasta and other products, particularly gelato. Don't miss the tubs of gelato in the freezer section in the most delectable flavors. I didn't buy any this time but definitely will the next time I go here.","134797":"I discovered this place while i was getting my hair done at the salon next door (my stylist opened up her own place now so I don't go to this one anymore.) It's a total italian deli\/grocery that is authentic in every way. I've only had on thing on the menu because it is the most amazing thing ever - the caprese sandwich on focaccia. Oh...my...god. I got into the whole tomato, mozzarella, basil, balsamic combo when I visited Tuscany a few years ago, and this is the BEST - it's so fresh and delish. I want to go there right now and get one!","135317":"Hmm. I'm not so sure about this one.\n\nThe sandwiches are A-ok. Not great. Not bad. I've certainly had better.\n\nI consider myself to be a sandwich snob. The bread wasn't really that great. The meat wasn't anything special. I could get the same deli meat at any other unique Italian Deli (it all comes from the same wholesaler), and the wait for this place is ridiculous.\n\nI came here because of the hype. \"Dave, you gotta try Defalco's\". I was let down. I was expecting my socks to be knocked off. Instead, I tripped on my shoe lace.\n\nEverything seemed stale and old. The guy at the counter was a bit abrupt and rude. \n\nThe only redeeming factor: Orangina.","136456":"If you haven't been here you need to go there now. It is a great Italian restaurants which great food and cheap prices.","137073":"This was a random surprise. It looks like a market but then we realized that the restaurant menu and ordering area is in the back , with the tables interspersed among the grocery isles. The market itself has a great selection of pasta, sauces, biscuits, and wine. The food itself is great.\n\nThe menu was huge and I kinda got lost in it so I ended up ordering a half turkey and provolone sandwich on nine grain, a cup of minestrone soup (which came with bread) and a side meat ball. The sandwich was good, it wasn't the best but good for the price. The minestrone was yummy. And the meatball was AMAZING!!! My fiance had the cheese steak sandwich, which was very tasty, but the clam chowder was pretty bland. \n\nThe wait was a bit long, but we really were not in a hurry so it was not a big deal. Also, the salads looks great. The next time I come here, I'm definitely getting another meatball, maybe try one of the other hot sandwiches and one of the salads.","137212":"I have been here a few times and every time I've eaten solid well made Italian food.\n\nThe front of the space is a market with pastas, frozen foods, and plenty of other neat little items to pick up on impulse. The deli and pastries are wonderful as well, my personal favorite is the rainbow cookies. \n\nWhen I go we normally share so I got the opportunity to try a good amount of items. The calzones to warn you are just as huge as they are delicious. The gnocchi in pesto was great and cooked perfectly. And the bruschetta sandwich was different than expected but still a good size and taste, once again was perfect. All of the pasta and noodles will be just what you're looking for. The allla vodka was perfectly creamy and rich! I can't give this little spot enough praise and suggestion if what you are craving is home cooked heavy Italian food.","137560":"The pizza is really good, but I always recommend the cheese steak,and the penne pasta with vodka sauce and chicken","137568":"Been going here for 13 years now!!!! My favorite Italian place in Arizona!!! This place is a gem! Chicken Parm sub is my favorite. And they have rainbow cookies that are delish","137939":"I ordered a pizza sub here and it was great.  They have a variety of different breads to choose from.  I really like the focaccia bread and the roll the best. The sandwiches are big and taste fresh.\n\nI am looking forward to trying the pasta in the future.","138811":"Love this place!  Have passed it many times and wondered...is a market?  Is it a restaurant?  Was happy to find out it's a bit of both. They have a menu of delicious sounding  sandwiches, salads, pizza, pasta...it was hard to chose.  Can't wait to go back!","140504":"Been coming here for 14+ years. Love everything about this place! Being Italian love coming to pick up some Italian products and grab a lunch too.The pesto pasta is the best! My sons love the Italian beef sandwich.","140695":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and people! Everything I've tried is awesome, especially desert!! Best mom and pop shop around!","140946":"Chicken cheesesteak is amazing, fettuccine alfredo is so creamy, and the chicken parmigiana is unbelievable!! I could eat here every day. Everything is delicious.","141146":"I have been here twice and ordered the chicken pesto sandwich both times. It explodes with flavor. Everyone in my group ordered something different and there wasn't a single person disappointed. It can get busy around lunch time, but that's the price you pay sometimes if you want the best!","141500":"Busy (line from the counter to the door) but don't be scared off because they have quick service. Happy hour til 7 seemed decent but we were too late. My friend had the meatball sub and it was the best one I've tasted. We got it with sub bread and it was perfect. They also have several other bread options (sesame, crunchy baguette, etc).  The linguine (pasta options are spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine, and penne) was a bit mushy but I liked the basic marinara sauce - it had some heat with lots of red pepper flakes. The sausage was bland - I would go for the big, fluffy meatballs. The garlic bread had a lot of herbs but was also surprisingly bland. This place is inexpensive and laid back - it has a family owned feel that I like. Everything has a lot of options as I mentioned above, and you can do half or whole orders (half was plenty for me). There is a soda fountain and free refills. \n\nBased on my spaghetti and sausage meal I would give 3 stars but that meatball sub was honestly amazing. Next time I am definitely getting a sandwich!","141686":"Coming from Chicago, it's great to find an authentic Italian-style deli near me! Their sandwiches and pastas are great and I'm excited to try things from the deli case. The best part is all the Italian goodies that my mom used to buy for us back home. Love this place.","141696":"Love this place! My go to is always a sandwich but there really isn't a bad thing on the menu from pasta to deserts.","142078":"After a long drive from Oceanside CA to Scottsdale AZ,  the clerk at the hotel suggested Defalco's (he was nice enough to give us a directions) for an Italian dinner place.\nDefalco's is a combo of a store and restaurant. You are ordering you food at then waiting for the food at the table. We ordered a 12 inch pizza and a one salad (I was told it will be enough for a 2 persons and it was). Well, this is not a NJ pizza and I did not expect it to be(see my review for a La Gondola Pizzeria) , but for the  Scottsdale it's OK. Seating inside with the temperature at 87 F at 7:00 PM with no A\/C (fans only), I don't know how so many people were preferring outside seating (one star down).","142394":"This place is great. Reminds me of the delis on the corners of NYC. Very authentic Italian food. Tastes wonderful :) \n\nOnly negative is that the seating is very limited, but I guess it adds more of a NY feel. :)","142690":"We watched an episode of diners, drive-ins & drives and saw this place. While headed to Tx from CA we made a stop at Defalco's. The food was outstanding and so were the people working there. I ordered the meat raviolis which came with a side salad & garlic bread, everything was delicious!!! My husband ordered a sausage sandwich and loved it as well. The environment was great, staff was willling to answer any questions, overall I loved this spot! \n\n\nAlso the strawberry swirl cheesecake was exceptional, I wish I had ordered another slice and a sandwich to go.","142817":"I have loved Defalco's for years. They have a terrific Chicken Parm sandwich. And the canolli's are delicious.  I've tried several sandwiches at lunch and nothing disappoints.  They use Boar's Head meats and you can taste the difference.\n\nIf you are coming to eat in, don't come around lunch time. It fills up fast. It has a tiny eating area (surrounded by the groceries: Italian canned foods, wines, specialty items), and a patio.  \n\nOrder ahead and come with patience.  But it is worth it!","144478":"I have been shopping at DeFalco's back when it was on 44th and Thomas Rd. I have to say the meatballs and Italian sausages are slipping big time. I just fried some hot sausage.....bland. The same time I bought the sausages I also purchased meatballs. Never again. Both use to taste like my mother's and grandmother's. I will make my own. Much better.","144930":"Honest opinion bc I love food: The food was mediocre ...and it smells there really....really...bad around the \"fresh sausage.\" No stomach pain..or nausea. Thank god. Would not go back.\n\nP.S. your cashier who worked on August 6th 2018 at around 5 o'clock was extremely rude...and I have no idea why...all I said was may you please add extra virgin olive oil on the maximus sandwich..and she responded..we don't have that oil...rolled her eyes...and went ahead to help her other worker...then continued to take down our order...very...very...weird.","146395":"The only problem is the lunch rush. Call ahead! This is an Italian grocery store, so you can find some unique ingredients, exotic beers, wines, and sweets. I have only had sandwiches here I had a Tuna sub, and a meatball sub on separate occasions. Generous portions for the price, the bread is fresh baked. The meatballs are a nice array of seasoning. the tuna itself was ok, nothing too special, but the bread makes up for it. I am a sucker for pizzelle (anise flavored cookies) and Defalco's has some incredible pizzelle I like to bring it in for my coworkers every now and then, and they love it too!","146610":"I didn't know you could eat here until a friend took me, I've had the chicken park sandwhich and the Italian sausage sand which and it's been totally on point everytime. The marinara needs to be on a slow drip into my body it's that good.","147092":"Dear Defalco's,,\n\nI'm sorry I didn't give you a fair shot sooner. The first time I visited you there must have been something \"interesting\" cooking and the smell turned me right around and I didn't want to come back. \n\nI finally got over it months later and gave you a try, and I'm glad I did. Your \"vegetarian\" sandwich wasn't just lettuce, mayo and cheese. It was overflowing with yummy veggies like carrots, onions and avocado and tasty italian dressing. The wheat roll was crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.\n\nUnfortunately some peppers from another area in the deli case made their way into my fruit salad, and my lemon bar tasted bland and bitter. Other than that, I'm glad I gave you another chance and I will surely be back again. Maybe pizza and a more authentic italian desert next time.\n\nKind regards,\n\nMolly","147475":"Defalco's is a little Italy in Scottsdale. Just came back from a vaca in Italy and this place made me feel that the trip has not yet ended. Margherita pizza is very authentic. Cheese Ravioli was a little on the dry side but tasted good. \nA waiter told us their sandwiches are the best. Will go back to try their grilled veggie sandwich..\nYou can find a wide range of balsamic vinegars, pastas, Italian seasonings and lot more. Looks like it will save me a trip to the other continent in future.","148178":"It's lost it's flare years ago best Italian deli hands down these days the staff is slow and the food is the exact same heavy on the sauce all the same salads sandwiches decor blah over crowded with stuff everywhere and the price per value has gone way up maybe because diners drive ins and dives did a show there a few years back not my favorite but you may like it","149645":"Excellent food. It's crazy crowded during lunch time so I usually go around 1:30, 2:00. Their roast beef sandwich is delicious with roasted peppers.","151939":"First time and we are obsessed!! Definetely worth the ride (we live on the West Valley). We ordered Centurion pizza, Il Purista sandwich and eggplant parmigiana sandwich to try and we looooved it all!! Foccacia bread is delicious, the pizza crust and the sauce to die for!! Definetely the best italian deli I have been to and I will recommend it to all my friends and family. It is very casual, you order by the register and they call your number and take your food to your table. We waited around 15 minutes for the pizza and sandwiches so that made us very happy (we were starving). It is very very family oriented and we loved that too!! You wont be disappointed ;) great food, friendly staff!!","152253":"This is a \"South\" Scottsdale neighborhood hangout in an average strip mall but we enjoy this place so we'll travel south for 30m to get here.  Authentic, fresh deli with amazing choices.  Beer & wine available.  Outside patio.  Minimal indoor seating.  \"Can-do\" service!  You'll have to browse the grocery offerings that aren't in the big stores:  everything from oils to gelato.  Enjoy!  DeFalcos is a treasure.","152380":"I had read about this place and had it on my bookmark list for quite some time.  I don't know how I never made it down here until the other day!\n\nIt was my 38th Birthday on Saturday (June 11th) and I was hanging out with a buddy from work and my brother in law.  I wanted to head down to Scottsdale and grab a sandwich here and then go smoke a cigar (see previous review).  We made our way down here around noon, walked in, got in line and ordered our sandwiches.  I went with a Large \"Maximus\".  My brother in law bought my lunch for me so I didn't pay squat ;-).  Regular price for that sandwich was around $10.00.  Here is how it was............\n\nThe Maximus-  This is a premium Italian sub!  Whenever I am new to a deli, I always tend to get their version of an Italian sub.  Happy to report, the Maximus is fantastic!  This sandwich came layered with Prosciutto, Capocollo, Genoa Salami, Mortadella and Provolone Cheese.  I got it topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing.  I chose the seeded sub roll as my bread.  This thing was set down in front of me and I was instantly happy!   This sub is huge!  A solid 12 inches or so.  The seeded bread they use was fantastic!  It had seeds on all sides of the bread, just not the top halves.  It was nice and soft and made an excellent base for the toppings.  Next time, I might ask for it slightly toasted\/crisped up, because I think it would make it even better than it already was!  The meats were top notch quality and the produce was fresh.  The sandwich was just a tad dry and could have used more oil and vinegar, but besides that, it was damn near a perfect sub!  Definitely the best Italian sub I have had in Phoenix!  \n\nI will definitely be back to try out their other sandwiches.  I was highly impressed with the Maximus and if their other subs can come close to being as good as that one, I will be super satisfied.  Too bad its across the Valley, or I would be here way too often!  It was a great little store, and a fantastic birthday sandwich!  Good times!","152442":"This little place tucked just south of the main Scottsdale drag is quite a gem. I found a food tasting forum on-line which mentioned it as a noteworthy stop for some really great food. That was an understatement; from the parking lot it looks a little sketchy but never judge a book by it's cover.\n\nNot only is this place very easy on the wallet, it's so interesting!  In addition to being a deli it is also a small Italian grocery with numerous wines, oils, cheeses, and meats.  I originally stopped in for their Philly Cheese steak and, having been to Philadelphia this past year I can honestly say this sandwich earns that name, so delicious.\n\nIf I'm ever in the area I love to take my friends and family for a bite to eat.","152491":"Yum!!! Total local spot and it's great. The eggplant parmigiana sandwich was amazing!!","153248":"This is the best Italian deli in town... Hands down! The best Italian food and sandwiches. The cheesesteak sandwich is the best in town. The antipasta salad is great! The eggplant parm is very tasty. A must try no matter where you live in metro Phoenix area... Worth the drive!!!","153899":"AMAZING. The cheese steak is the cats pajamas. The chicken parm sandwich is heavenly. I would like to try other items, but I cannot stray from my usual as they are too delicious. Would be five stars if their service was a teensy bit faster, but not a big deal. It's worth the wait!","154022":"I might have loved the food, but the attitude of the place sent us out the door before ordering. Being new to DeFalcos, I wasn't real sure how to order cheese and salami from the deli - we didn't want a sandwich made. We stood around trying to catch the eye of the two men behind the deli counter and finally had to interrupt him as he finished with a customer.  Without a word, or even looking at me, he flicked his thumb towards the back of the room. We decided he wasn't that interested in our money and left. Great food is important, but customer service - not letting a (potentially) good customer get away - is just as important.","154038":"Defalcos is more of a small Italian store than a restaurant, but it is definitely an awesome place to get authentic Italian food.  I tried the Half portion meat lasagna which comes with a side of garlic bread. If you order the full plate, it comes w a salad. But the half portion is enough to feed any appetite.\n\nThe sauce was amazing and the Lasagna had tons of cheese with homemade sausage which literally made me tear as i was eating this meal. Will return many times as i have found a hidden gem.\n\nPlace was also clean. Not a big dining area, thats the only negative. They would be wise to expand this place as the food is amazing. 5 stars easily!!","154167":"went today for Italian groceries and deli items, we stood at counter for 20 minutes before the workers would even speak with us, the deli staff took so long to help us we ended up leaving,i was prepared to spend a lot of money for their products,because Italian goods are hard to find in Arizona,i guess because we did not go with a tv crew we were less important!!!!! Will never go back,rather have my goods shipped directly to my home from back east!!!!","155252":"I have only had the cheesecake, but it was soo good I made a ridiculous video on how great the Cheesecake is! Enjoy: http:\/\/1drv.ms\/1M0VE4C","155340":"Best beef cheese steak sandwich EVER!\n\nThis place is adorable. The name is very fitting as you can get just about any shape pasta noodle you can imagine. \n\nThe icing on the cake is the sandwiches though. Served on Italian bread that is as standard soft and fluffy inside with a slight crisp to the outside. The deli has fantastic cheese and meet options. \n\nTopher (the boyfriend who I will now call by name since he is almost always with me when I visit new places) had the Italian sausage and peppers sandwich that he too greatly enjoyed. \n\nCasual, classic and a must stop stop.","155592":"I could eat here everyday! I love the steak and cheese & calzone!!!! This place is absolutely phenomenal and I would recommend it to everybody","156862":"I crave the il purista from Defalco's at least once a week. It's such a simple sandwich, but it's the best -and closest to a NY deli-, I'm going to get in Scottsdale.. \n\n I prefer dining in. There's patio seating, a TV usually with a good game on and good music - Pinback, The Shins, Fleet Foxes?! (Although I was iffy about staying last time to enjoy my meal, due to the fact that Morrissey was playing.. but I'm pretty sure it was a huge mistake\/defect and it won't happen again)\n\n The staff here reminds me of the neighborhood deli's back East: until they know you, they don't care what you order, what you think and who you are..but when they start recognizing you, you feel like part of a secret family.\n\n It may be a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. I prefer quality of food and quality of staff, as opposed to how fast I can choke it down on my lunch break. \n\n Savor it.","157331":"We have been enjoying the food at Defalco's for the past 7 years. The reason I cannot give 5 stars is because although the food is always tasty, the service is mediocre, always.I've expereinced quite a few inconsistent orders - the dressing to my salad is wrong, bread isn't included in the bag when I get home, etc. When you walk in for a pick up order the staff is always frazzled, rushed and seems understaffed. Last night was my last straw. We placed an order over the phone at 5:30, it was supposed to take 30 minutes. We went to pick it up, stood around waiting for 25 minutes while staff completely ignored me, didn't seem to have a clue what was going on - then they tried to give me my food that had been sitting ready for 20 minutes. I don't want old food. I left the food and got my money back. Needless to say I think I'm done ordering food from here.","158090":"Great pizza. Loved the ambience if sitting and dining in a grocery store. Not cheap but worth every penny.","158105":"Great sausage and pepper sandwich, reasonably priced.","158340":"Saw this place on that tv show, diners\/drive ins\/dives.....food is authentic...and fabulous!!!  Tried the Itaian sausage sandwich, the meatball sandwich, and several pastas.  The salads are great, and save room for a lemon bar or piece of cheesecake.  Yum!!!  Good for eat in, and for take home....enjoy!!","158364":"Very good hot sandwiches...  I especially like their Philly cheese steak and their Italian sausage sandwiches...","158898":"Real, true authentic Italian. I haven't had anything close to his authentic since I went to Italy last summer. Non pretentious and set up like an Italian supermarket you can buy pretty much all Italian delicacies. Affordable. By far one of my favorite places to go.","159029":"went there for lunch. The line was pretty long, but I got through relatively quickly. It may be hard getting a seat as this place is pretty small, though I lucked out and had my sub outdoors on their patio.\n\nMy italian sub was very tasty, though it lacked the italian dressing promised on the menu. Since the service isn't waitered, and the line was so long, I didn't try to get up to ask for the sub to be fixed.\n\nI'll go back there again, but don't expect great service or a slow meal. It's for folks in a rush who need to get something and run out. Call in ahead and pick it up later if you can -- that's a separate line","159030":"We ordered 3 whole eggplant parm meals to go plus baklava and a cannoli. Sauce was my favorite part! Eggplant was pretty good - should've come with a knife. Garlic bread was kinda stale. Side salad was really nice and included more variety of veggies than I typically get with a side salad. Wished the baklava had more layers of phyllo but good flavor. Cannoli was also good. We didn't order pizza but the pizzas they were bringing out for other people looked really good.","160596":"This is one of my regular stops. Authentic New York style Italian deli that serves dine-in sandwiches and such. The food is excellent, the prices are decent and the atmosphere is great. It can get crowded at times, but don't let that deter you, it moves quickly. I usually get the Meatball sandwich on a hard roll....it's magnificent.","161245":"Love this little piece of Italy in the valley! Great gourmet deli meats and cheeses and Italian imports of all kinds- including gems like squid ink pasta and European Nutella. All the sandwiches I've tried are good, but I prefer the hot (usually steak with mushrooms and onions or sausage). The home-made raviolis are large delightful pillows of deliciousness, and the meatballs are nice and big. I sometime order one a-la-carte, and sprinkle on the peperoncino and parmigiano reggiano. For the dessert try the Napoleon!","162340":"Overrated is one work to describe. I ordered the philly cheese steak for my fianc\u00e9 and I got the margarita pizza for myself.  The bread on the philly was not very soft, however the meat was\nLegit.  The only reason I came here was because I was craving a TRUE margarita pizza which was what the menu read. Tomatoes, basil, evoo , fresh mozzarella, basil.  when I got my pizza, I got pizza sauce , 4 tomatoes, mozzarella cheese spread on the whole thing, and a few pieces of fresh mozzarella. The menu is deceiving,  looks like they pay attention to detail when it comes to ingredients, but it tasted sub par.  I don't think I need to visit this restaurant for a while . Wasn't terrible but wasn't fantastic.","163117":"I have been to Defalco's so many times in the past, but since I had not been in quite some time due to moving out of the area I did not feel I could review it.  But I am back in the area because my company moved to the new Sky Song location right down the street.  I was so excited to come back to Defalco's!  It is still as good as I remember:)... I had the hard salami and provolone sub with a side of veggie pasta salad.  So Good!  this is going to be one of my regular lunch locations for sure!","164741":"Not really much of a grocery store but a great little deli and restaurant.  I had a wonderful calzone that was enough for two meals.  My friend had a sandwhich with a side of antipasti salad that looked really good as well.  A small selection of wine and beer but the reason to go here is all about the food.  Didnt try the desserts but might next time if I have room.","164946":"Best chicken parm in town, best cheesesteak in town, best Italian grocery in town.  I wish they move to a more comfortable location, but in a way, the cramped nature is part of the charm.  Love this place.","165097":"Went in with high expectations since this place appeared on food network's diners, drive ins, and dives and it surpassed them.  It definitely fits the definition of a dive. Defalco's is a grocery store with tables wherever they can fit, but don't let looks deceive you.\n\nCenturion calzone, the Italian sausage, and the canollis here are some of the best I've ever had. Definitely would recommend!","166361":"This place has a very nice inviting atmosphere and feels really mom-and-pop.  They also have a few racks of groceries that you can look through and purchase from.  One of these days I will buy cannoli shells and make my own cannolis!  In the meantime, I think I'll just order their food.  This particular time I had the bruschetta sandwich, which once I saw it I kind of had to laugh at myself for ordering it.  Bruschetta is kind of just like an open face sandwich, so to make it a sandwich you just have to close the breads over one other and boom sandwich.  And that's pretty much what mine looked like.  Honestly, I was a slightly disappointed by how mine looked especially next to my dad's chicken parm., sandwich that was jam packed.  However, I will say, my sandwich was pretty darn good and was very favorable and even though I probably won't order it the next time I visit, it won't be because it didn't taste good, because it tasted very good.  Rather I will get something else because it all sounds so good!","166442":"The best local Italian deli in Scottsdale. No contest. The food is excellent and I love the atmosphere.  Very authentic neighborhood deli\/grocery.  Gourmet pizza to boot. Prices are reasonable and the quality is outstanding.  Great selection of wines and some imported beers. Patio sitting is a good choice on a beautiful Scottsdale day or evening,  inside seating is among the grocery shelves. Typical of a NY deli.you can't miss with the cheese steak sandwich,  any pasta or pizza. You won't be sorry.","167722":"This place is fantastic. Went with my family and everyone got something different. No one had any complaints about anything. I had the beef cheesesteak and wow. Sooo good! Highly recommend it! \n\nYou have to get a cannoli as well. They are legit awesome! \n\nCan't speak any higher about this place. If you visit Scottsdale and don't go here, you're missing out!","169949":"My favorite go to place for a sandwich and pick up dough and pizza toppings to make at home. Love this place!!","170603":"This place is awesome! I had the roast beef and Italian sausage .....AWESOME! Then I had the corned beef sandwich with cole slaw and fresh mozzarella. OH MY GOD! You have to try this. This place reminds me of some of the Italian spots back home in Detroit.","171026":"If you're looking for great Italian, Defalco's is the place.\n\nTheir lasagna is so good that I have dreamed about missing a slice of their meaty, cheesy, saucy goodness. I really like the sausage they use because I can taste the fennel and it just ties everything together. Lasagna is pretty expensive to make at home. (All I know is that when my bf and I made homemade lasagna, we spent almost $80 on all the ingredients. But maybe we splurged too much on expensive cheese idk lol) \n\nA slice of lasagna here should set you back $9. Not bad because it is a pretty hefty serving. I always have to take half of it home, especially since it's served with a piece of garlic bread.\n\n\nWe also tried the cheese ravioli. Scrub mistake. Order the meat ravioli because the ravioli is already good, but the meat takes it over the top. I love their red sauce so much I could drink it.\n\nThe first time my bf and I came here, we thought one tiramisu cup was going to be enough for the both of us. It wasn't. The tiramisu is so creamy and the amount of coffee is just right. Now we always order 2 tiramisus so we don't have to fight over who gets the last bite :)\n\n\nThe restaurant is pretty cozy inside but I think the environment definitely makes it a cute date spot for good food.","171286":"Love love this place I'm originally from NY and usually we had our favor spot back home. It took us sometime to find a similar or better place here in az but this place is great everything is good n I mean everything","171399":"I believe that I have found the country's best cold sandwich. The \"Il Purista\" is stuffed with thin-cut prosciutto, thick-cut fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers & enough basil leaves to make a large pizza. The balsamic vinegar & extra virgin olive oil complete the beauty that is served on your choice of bread. Since I'm keeping with the purist theme, I opted for the traditional Italian sub roll. \n\nThis place is oh so much more than just a phenomenal sandwich joint, it is a full-on Italian grocery & butcher shop\/delicatessen. Indoor seating can be a little scarce during busy times but there is something special about sitting next to racks of cannoli shells & lady fingers. \n\nNow, I want dessert","172371":"amazing back east feel! food is tremendous, service impeccable. Definitely a hidden gem of Scottsdale. Eggplant parmesan was delicious, thinks crusty outside, delicious chewy inside, and the marinara, yum! Sausage and beef combo just melts in your mouth, complete with marinara and au jus, perfect.","172409":"Excellent choice for take out, simple menu with good pastas, sandwiches and desserts. Their pizza isn't my favorite.","172849":"I absolutely LOVE Defalco's! Quaint, charming, one-of-a kind place with authentic Italian Food. What more could you ask for?\n\nStart of RANT: In perusing some of the other reviews I noticed some yelpers don't agree with my rating. Sorry, but who in their right mind goes to an Italian Grocery and DOESN'T order Italian food, then gives the place a poor rating? WTH? I don't go to Mexican place, order a pasta and expect them to experts at it. End of RANT.\n\nBack to the review. I had the combo sandwich cold, while my partner had the Italian Sausage with peppers and onions. Both were excellent and the service was great.\n\nNow if we only had a place like this up in the vast wasteland called Desert Ridge.","173581":"The food is 5 stars! \n\nAbsolutely delicious!\n\nBUT 3.5 stars overall.\n\nNegatives include the SLOW service.  DO NOT go here if you are already hungry.  You can literally feel yourself aging while you stand helplessly waiting for your food.  It's not uncommon to wait a good 20 - 30 minutes.\n\nAlso a negative - Price.  I'm guessing they probably do have all of their ingredients flown in from Italy, because the price reflects it.  I guess you do get what you pay for.  Typically you'll spend $10 for a sandwich, $3-$5 on sides and $2-$3 for your drink.  The happy hour prices seem okay ($2 beer).\n\nSeating is extremely limited.  Barely any room to even move around in here.  Also, your table is so close to the other tables that people are participating in your conversation.  Kinda creepy!  The outdoor seating is basically lawn-chair, patio furniture. \n\nAnd Location\/Parking.  Not the best, especially with the crazy road construction.  But I guess in the end...  It is what it is.   I still return and will continue to help support local businesses.","174153":"The wait time for 2 sandwiches are ridiculous if you didn't put a phone order in. Fifty minutes! 50!","175321":"My family and I loved everything. I got the meatball sandwich and cookie. Fun place to check out all kind Italian goodies.","175577":"We had lunch here. We split a Rubin. Which was plenty for the two of us. The sandwiches we saw others enjoying were huge. Half order is enough for all but the biggest of eaters. Our sandwich was excellent and we will go back. We also bought some deli meats and cheeses all of it very good.","175630":"Heard about this place on Dinners, Drive-in's and Dives. So glad we came here as it was better than expected.  The meatballs are delicious and remind me of long ago days of my youth. Huge portions, we shared a meatball sub. Can't wait to come back.","176003":"This place was so great! I was a little confused about how the ordering process worked because it isn't a restaurant-restaurant where you sit and order which is what I expected, but just hop in line, the menu is hanging above the deli counters. Speaking of the deli counters... Yum! The sausage and salami looks so good I wish I had bought some, maybe I will before I return to Vegas. The desserts are also gorgeous and delicious looking, I ended up getting the chocolate covered cannoli which was fantastic-the filling especially! \n My fianc\u00e9 ordered the meat lasagna which was tasty and I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich that was so perfect! The mushroom is marinated and has a real sharp bite to it and then you get the delicious goat cheese with it which just kills it. \nWe came because of triple d, and after our huge let down earlier that morning this place just shined even more!","176019":"This place is the real deal.  Excellent Italian food on the quick.  Everything from pasta to pizza and huge Italian sandwiches.  We can't get enough of their cannolis either.  The place has excellent customer service and offers such a unique dining experience because of it's location within an Italian market.  Great finds to take home and cook as well.\n\nI recommend the cheesesteak, the chicken parmsean sandwich, any pizza, anything with their Italian sausage.  They also offer an excellent craft beer selection including local beers and awesome wines.","176281":"I really wanted to love this place because it is so close to me..but no such luck.  I ordered the Beef Cheese Steak, and when it arrived it looked so good but my first bite revealed an overly cheesy and flavorless chopped meat.  Granted, I did not get the peppers and onions but I expected the meat to be able to hold it's own..I was wrong.  Too bad, the search continues.","176772":"Really the best to deli to eat at. Their food is always great and you never wait for long. They always have an A grading for food safety. Outside seating is nice as well. Really nothing bad I can say about this place.","178055":"One of the best Italian Grocers on this side of town. I love all the Specialty Foods they carry especially their selection of sauces. I have chosen random items at DeFalco's and have never had an item I have it enjoyed. Can't go wrong with anything here there are just a few things that are priced a little bit High but are completely worth it","178374":"So, I fly in to Scottsdale to visit a friend and while I am waiting for her to get ready for dinner I am watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and featured on that episode was DeFalco's.  So naturally we decide karma dictates we eat there.  DeFalco's is a market\/deli\/restaurant and is pretty much set up like a deli with tables.  You order at the counter and then they bring your food out to you. We ordered the Centurion calzone, eggplant parm sub and the sausage with peppers and onions sub.  All three dishes were great. We washed all that food down with a really good bottle of reasonably priced wine.  Before leaving I went to the counter to grab a to go box and I saw the owner (I recognized him from the Triple D episode) and I spoke to him a bit.  He was a really cool guy and you could tell we was really passionate about serving good food and   proud of his families long standing business. Overall great place, great food and service to boot.  If you are in the mood for classic Italian comfort food in a laid back setting or something to bring back home, Deflaco's is your place.","178485":"One of the Best Italian delis and restaurants I have been to in the valley!!  Super good food, cute little quaint cafe with an amazing deli counter!!  Fantastic pizza, fettuccine is amazing!!  Their calzones are out of this world!!  I ordered a small and it was bigger than my head!!","178505":"Try the Italian Combo for lunch on marble rye bread and you will thank me later. Great atmosphere, great food and don't forget to buy sweets on the way out. \n\nPerfect for lunch.","178685":"I really love this place. I love the pasta, pizza, and sandwiches. Basically I love everything, including the imported Italian goods I can't usually find at the local grocery. Their wine selection is pricey and I've found the same wines for much less at Total Wine. Tip: call in your order because you might find yourself eating outside on a very hot day if it's too busy.","178796":"I have NEVER had a bad experience here!! I've been coming since 2010 and try to bring everyone who hasn't tried it! The pastas, pizzas, and of course the cheesesteak on a sub roll  cannot go wrong at this place.","181069":"Impressive Italian market with large selection of olive oils, vinegars, dried pastas, sauces, etc... They also have a large deli selection of meats and cheeses. The menu of prepared items is large and varied. I was on business travel and couldn't take home any of the tempting market items, but I did get the Il Purista sandwich and a side of the marinated Greek salad to go. Both were fresh and delicious. While waiting for my order, I checked out some of the plates being brought out to dine-in customers. The calzones are the size of a football and the meatballs are as big as tennis balls. The staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely visit again the next time I'm in town.","182005":"Horrible sums this place up! Stale bread with stale toppings. I will not give them a second try.","183232":"I have had nothing but great experiences here, and we come at least once a month.  We've found the grocery\/deli items to be failry-priced and delicious.  The food is top-notch--we take all of our out-of-town friends\/family here and they are ecstatic.  Meatballs are phenomenal and salads are out of this world.  Their \"imported from NY\" cheesecakes make you want to cry with joy.  I have never eaten a better cannoli--and that's no lie.  I have read the complaints about service, but it's a deli--not a full-serve restaurant.  I find their food and offerings on-par with New York.  I would actually say their service is better than NY--maybe a bit of attitude here (if you want to bring one as well) but not even CLOSE to something you'd find in Brooklyn or Queens.  We've tried a lot of Italian places here in the Valley and this is our top pick.  If you don't go there expecting royal treatment you will be nothing but happy!","183491":"I've been a patron for years (at least 17 years and counting) and the food is consistently delicious. You can't beat their party trays if you're having a celebration where people appreciate real Italian food. \nMy all-time favorite item to order is the caprese salad. On a bed of fresh, crisp romaine and green lettuce, with thick slices of tomato and some of the best fresh mozzarella around. Simple, classic and always perfect.","183711":"Excellent food and groceries, but this is a very poorly managed establishment. The employees literally look like they are moving in slow motion. There is zero organization in the deli, and customers walk around aimlessly since there are no clear signs indicating where to go. I come here about once a week, and it's the same story everytime. Plan to spend over twenty minutes just to pick up some deli items. The problems could be drastically improved with simple signs, but they are popular and management probably just doesn't care. The quality of the food will keep bringing people back until another deli\/restaurant opens next door.","184515":"cool place. really is more of a grocery that happens to serve italian food. portions are good and the price is right. i worry that I might lean from my chair and tip over stuff on the shelves but other than that it's fun looking place.","185002":"To start, a quick tip for first timers here, plan on spending some time here. Not because it's a massive store, or the wait for food takes forever, it's just that Defalco's is that popular and usually always packed. If you aren't happy about that, take it up with Guy Fieri. \n\nThat being said, I really do enjoy this nice Italian grocery. The food they put out is consistent which is pretty key, and it's just flat out delicious. It's traditional Italian food done traditional ways. This isn't Olive Garden. \n\nI usually get some ravioli or pasta for lunch here and afterwards buy some salami or sausage to take home along with some pasta. There are two really good traditional Italian grocery stores in Scottsdale, and this is one of them for sure. \n\nThe only downfall to this, is the previous mentioned popularity. It's not a big shop, it doesn't have a ton of seating and you feel a bit crammed while in line. There is definitely plenty of parking though. I would love to see them move to a bigger location and thrive more and be able to accommodate the crowds they usually accrue on any given afternoon. \n\nBottom line. Go here. Eat great food. Be happy.","185463":"Loved it!  Glad to say it's the first place I've eaten in AZ.  The gentleman behind the counter was very outgoing and helpful through our decision making. The food was delicious (Italian and Purista sandwiches, with side salads). \n\nIf I lived here, I'd be here a lot!!","185541":"I had a lunch meeting today and we decided to deli, but the question was Italian or kosher deli?\nI hadn't been to De Falco's for over a year, so it seemed to be a good day to revisit and have a sandwich on the patio.\nI was a fan before and I am a fan now.\nI had the Italian beef with peppers and onions, and my only comment is that I wish they would dunk the entire sandwich in au jus (I think it's OK to get messy to have a good time...in fact it may be required). \nThat's not really a complaint, mind you, just a comment. De Falco's gives you plenty of love in the form of a nice big sandwich with great ingredients, great fresh bread choices (crunchy italian roll is the best for sandwich like this).\nMy lunch companion had the chicken parm (he had never been to De Falco's, or really an italian deli of any sort) and he was really pleased with his selection as well (in fact as we were leaving he saw one of the pizza's and said he was going to give them try for pizza this weekend, so he really was impressed).\nThe only other italian deli\/sandwich shop in Phoenix that I've tried is Luke's of Chicago (I know, not really the same, but some of the sandwiches are similar and italian beef is italian beef, so...). I think De Falco's is substantially better, and their broad selection of sandwiches, meals and other take out really gives them a leg up.\nService is courteous, prompt and everything shows up at the table hot and on time. \nGreat place for lunch, and take out italian!","185820":"Food: Once I have found a spot I really enjoy I am always looking to try new things on their menu. I hate judging a restaurant off only one meal because one experience is not always that telling. However, every time I got to Defalcos I thoroughly enjoy my meal and my dessert.  Their meatball sandwich will have you licking your fingers and you plate! Down to the bread they use, this sandwich is awesome. What I like most about this deli is just how fresh the food taste as well as authentic. Beyond the meatball sandwich their calzones, and eggplant lasagna are great. On the dessert menu you MUST try their cannoli and their baklava.  \n\nLocation: On the outside they do not look like much at all, but as you go in Defalcos has a fun ambiance. It very much reminds me of the New York style deli and grocery. There is not much seating but if you can snag a seat I definitely recommend staying awhile because their dessert is just as awesome as their food.\n\nStaff: The staff is primarily Italian (so you know its good) and are very friendly.","186136":"Well since my first review about a month ago, I have been back to DeFalco's every Friday since and it is amazing. It has become my \"bucket list\" to have everything on their menu. So far my wife and have had their, Pizza Bianca and Pizza Margherita,Meatball and Sausage\/Beef combo Hero's,Lasagne, Caprese Salad, The \"Centurion\" Calzone and of course,Cannoli's,Chocolate Eclairs,Strawberry Cheesecake and a Napoleon. I met Anthony DeFalco tonight and not only is he nice man,he cares about his customers satisfaction. A shout out to Robert who usually takes our orders and makes this wonderful experience even better.  I highly recommend DeFalco's. It is not fancy as you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table,but fancy doesn't make great Italian Food, DeFalco's does!!!","186328":"I love Defalco's and it's become almost a weekly staple. Their penne alla vodka is my FAVORITE & I always order the full portion so I can get the side salad w\/ Caesar and the garlic toast. A lot of times, we will just call our orders in & they are ready for pickup in like 20 minutes. \n\nI love this place so much and it's an amazing deal for the quality food that you get!","187456":"Awesome food! Hands down the best Italian deli in AZ \nJust a note - the owner solicits for tips but the employees never see any of the tips.  Have always tipped 40-50% of my tab & a little upset about it now because I believed the employees serving me were actually receiving the $ at the end of their shift. Not the case. \nI would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the owner soliciting for tips for his profit. Not cool :-|","188137":"Legit Italian deli! Yet to have anything bad, I would highly recommend the beefsteak on the sub roll. Call ahead of you don't have patience, because quality takes more then 5 minutes.","189316":"I've been there probably a hand full of times, and usually get a Calzone with garlic, spinach, and pepperoni. I did have a Cheese Steak sandwich and it was awesome! I can make my own calzone so I'll stick with sandwich from now on. Reasons not 5 stars: the place is small and trying to move around with a stroller or a lot of people is impossible, I was trying to call in an order and got placed on hold for 15 minutes, got hung up on, and then had to deal with a rude employee.","189736":"Nice atmosphere and friendly service. I was really looking forward to DeFalco's because it was on Triple D and because of the high Yelp rating, but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. \n\nThe Chicken Parm was dry and pizza not very Naples like given the Italian roots of this place. \n\nAlso had a cappuccino. My Nespresso expresso maker makes better cappuccino.  \n\nNext time in Arizona I will stick to the Mexican food.","190289":"Absolutely delicious!!! First time so I tried the Alfredo, hubby tried the spaghetti and meatballs- both were fantastic. Oh and dessert so many choices! Their lemon cake was to die for! My new favorite place! Can't wait to go back!","191260":"Love this place. Reminds me of East Coast. Always have the chicken cutlet sandwich. This time I had the pesto and was amazing","191325":"So food is great! BUT service OMG slow and no awareness. So took forever to get food when not busy (10 people sitting half with food). Then I wanted to get a to go box. Well I went to front of line to quickly ask for one and cashier Never even noticed me. Was kinda in front of him. Then walking back to my seat a cool came out and sat behind me for his break. Asked him if they had boxes. Told me to go to another counter for phone in orders. Well then I was in line for a while as that took forever. I gave up told my girlfriend how that didn't work by the cool and he didn't even notice. Never checked if I got the box or anything.\n\nSo food good, service blows.","191420":"i might toy with the idea of maybe giving this place another shot and trying one of the pizza's or pastas...\n\ni just was not impressed. Waited 20+ min for the sandwich and when they finally brought it out it was on white bread when i asked for wheat. So right off the bat i was peeved. i didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for a damn sandwich so i sucked it up and put my big girl panties on and ate it anyway. it was alright, honestly just another sandwich.\n\nHowever they do have a considerable large choice of meats, cheese, pasta sides etc..i am a girl who likes choices. The atmosphere was also interesting as well, ya know, the whole Italian grocery store thing inside a restaurant is pretty creative.","192077":"I can't believe the BF & I wasted 30 minutes of our time at this place waiting for our cold cut Ham, Turkey & Provolone on sourdough & Pastrami on wheat roll sandwiches.  There were only a handful of people ordering at the time & in the store.  I'm assuming they were short handed that day, or had to fly all the way out to Italy to get our frickin' sandwich fixings.\n\nThe sandwiches were mediocre at it's best.  The sandwiches tasted bland and cold cuts were dry.  The crapeteria here at my work makes better sandwiches than this place.  \n\nI guess the saying, \"you get what you paid for\" is definitely true here & for a 1\/2 sandwich at $4.25, I shouldn't have expected too much, especially when I've been accustomed to some awesome sandwiches from Genova's Delicatessen & Specialty's Cafe & Bakery.\n\nOne good thing about this place was the guy behind the ordering counter.  He was friendly, upbeat & extremely helpful.\n\nWould I revisit this place next time I visit Scottsdale...ummm...no thank you!","192502":"Since moving here from Boston, I've been rather disappointed with the quality of food. Everything from pizza to Chinese food has really been nothing but let down after let down... especially the Chinese food... man is it bad.. like, you have to try to make Chinese food this bad.. the only real saving grace is the Mexican food and the happy hour (lets be honest... quality of food is NOT what you're after when going to happy hour). \n\nThat's why, when you do find a place around here that is head and shoulders above the rest, you need to tell everyone about it and always go back. Defalco's is just this kind of place. \n\nI pretty much agree with everyone when it comes to the cheese steak. Sure my arteries trembled with fear when it saw a massive amount of ooey gooey cheese rolling their way. but i didn't care... it was one of the best cheese steaks I've ever had. It was comparable to, or maybe even better than, my favorite from back east... La Cascia's Bakery & Deli's cheese steak (Burlington, MA). it had the perfect amounts of steak, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and cheese. as bobby said... goddamn.. \n\nSome lady also got a Chef Salad that looked out of this world. its an old fashioned Italian deli so its all high quality cold cuts and lot of them! \n\nOne last thing too rave about is, this place has has a lot of stuff that you cannot find in the grocery stores around here but were readily available back east. all of the Italian sauces, pastas, oils, vinegars, etc... next time i cook I'm definitely getting most of my stuff from here.","192506":"Great selection of sandwiches and deli salads. Some friends of mine go here every Friday and I joined them while in town once. It reminds me of the sandwich shop Fontanos in Chicago. Anyway, my sandwich was good, had turkey on a baguette and think I may have enjoyed something else better but still liked it. Also had their tortellini pasta salad which was awesome. Loved the outdoor patio and although we didn't get any beers, they have a great selection of those too. Very friendly people working there and looks like some interesting\/authentic Italian food in the grocery area.","192980":"Great selection of sandwiches at lunch.     Outstanding Italian market with a great butcher counter.   Team is always happy and helpful.  Nice outdoor patio when the weather gets cooler..","193406":"I usually steer away from places that have large lines and after a certain time I wont dare go here cause it can be hard to find a seat and the food does take a while to make but if you are taking a lunch around 11am you can squeeze in before the rush and grab some tasty foods. I have been going here for years and it took me a while to find what I think they do best and what I don't. Here is my ratings on each dish.\n\nPhilly cheese steak on hard bread with everything 5\/5 - best I've ever tried so far\nchicken fettuccine with garlic bread 5\/5 -  olive garden is one of my favs but this tops it in areas\ncalzones - 2\/5 pretty large but terrible\nside salads 2\/5 bland cafeteria quality\nItalian sausage with peppers- 2\/5 too large of ingredients throw off the taste\nprosciutto - 5\/5 some of the best tasting meat I have had\npizza - i cant recall it so I wont rate it\nturkey w\/ provolone 3\/5\n\nSo the line may be long or seating short depending on timing. It isn't the easiest to get a take out box if you decide after to take it with you. And it isn't the most beautiful place to sit down in with all the groceries around but damned if they don't have some killer food.","193476":"This Eatery\/Grocer is filled with everything you need for an Authentic Italian dinner at home or order a meal to eat in or take home. I had the Cheese Steak with fried peppers, onions & mushrooms at it was amazing! I gave it a 4star due to the wait. We stood in line for 10 minutes to order then waited about 30 minutes for our meal. Yes, worth it but next time I'd call in my order to go unless I'm there to shop the many items available.","193553":"BEST Italian food in town. Closest thing I can get to my grandmother's home-cooked pasta sauce. Make sure you come here with a hearty appetite because portions are generous and delicious. Be sure to try baked ziti and of course the cannoli. Clean place. Attentive staff.","193850":"Defalco's is amazingly delicious. The trick to getting your lunch in a timely fashion is to call ahead. It's usually ready in about fifteen minutes and you get to skip the line (as pickups are a separate cashier).\n\nThe cheesesteaks are phenomenally sinful, whether you go with the beef or the chicken. I try to eat healthily, but even I will admit weakness when faced with Defalco's. I'd like to see you resist once you have tasted their heavenly precursor to a heart attack, err, cheesesteak.\n\nAlso, don't skip dessert. The cannoli is epic.\n\nIf you want to eat in, there are tables along the windows. The grocery also has a good selection of Italian dry goods if you want to do something crazy like cook at home.","193885":"I know I've found a good place when my stomach starts grumbling as soon as I walk through the door. The earthy notes of garlic and onion with a little sweetness of fresh tomatoes simmering made me swoon as soon as I entered.  \nThe guy behind the counter was full of recommendations and super nice. I also loved being able to walk around and see all the different imported groceries.\nI have not had a bad experience at Defalco's.  \nI think I've ordered everything on the pasta side and have thoroughly enjoyed everything.  If I'm taking out my niece and nephews, this is one of my go to spots because I trust the service and quality of food, plus we can binge on the sweets after.  The sandwiches are also very good. They stay together well and have a good balance of flavors, plus the bread isn't overwhelming, nor does it fall apart. \nI have not tried the pizzas or calzones but the last time I was in, I caught a glimpse of one and believe I will have to make that my next target when I visit again.","196009":"Pretty good for takeout. Decent prices especially since all orders get garlic bread and whole orders get a salad. Salad would be nice if it didn't have onions, I always throw it away. Ive had a few of the dishes and some are excellent whereas others are average.\n\nStuffed Shells, pretty good but made differently each time it seems, sometimes they're more open face and melted or titled to the side with crumbly cheese in them. I prefer closed and stiffer shells myself.\n\nMac n Cheese, all the rage in the reviews but I can't see why. Penne with melted cheese on the bottom. Some of the top pasta was dry with no cheese. I could melt a cheese blend in a pot and pour it over pasta myself. Making a spice blend or crumbly baked mac in cheese is more effort so I'd pay someone to do that. I'll eat it but won't order again.\n\nMeatball Sandwich, very decent, big, saucy.\n\nPizza, decent, would order from time to time.\n\nQuaint (but very small and busy) eating area. Great alcohol selection but I couldn't find much merlot next to the wine. Great deli and for picking up your own ingredients.","196157":"Italian grocery - you can find what you need here for your next authentic Italian meal and they have the BEST sandwiches!\n\nCheesesteaks and cold Italian subs to die for. Get it on a sub roll!\n\nI love that I can acquire obscure ingredients and enjoy a delicious pesto gnocchi, Italian sub and rich dessert that is noteworthy here.\n\nPro tip: call ahead.","196317":"This place has pretty good authentic italian food. The chicken alfredo is delicious and there sandwiches are too. Their pastries are a little stale, but my fiance and I always come here for a nice dinner. I love the little market inside.","196657":"One of the guys who went to lunch with me just now just walked by and said, \"great lunch, fellas.  good choice.\"\n\nNo.\n\nReally i think this place deserves two stars but i guess that's a bit harsh.  What deserves five stars is the service level of the guy who took my order.  Good job.  He gave me a sample of the seafood salad even though it had to be a pain in the N-U-Tz to do so.  He was fine with my disaster of an ordering job, too.  It was all good.\n\nI got a veggie sandwich with avocado, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, and italian dressing.  sprouts maybe.  It was mediocre.  Really average.  I know you may tell me that they're an italian grocery! they shouldn't have amazing veggie subs! but I think that's crap, personally.  Anyway, I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just saying it isn't 5-star quality.  Dallas.\n\nAnyway, a guy I work with said we should go there and he immediately qualified his approval of the place by saying it was overrated--to his credit, because it is--and it was decent.  If I were the type to have a real italian sandwich then I'm sure it would be good.\n\nBut I *am* the type to have a cannoli and the cannoli was crap, when measured against the Grimaldi's-cannoli yardstick.  I would go so far as to say don't order it there--go down the street to grimaldi's and get it there.\n\nI might go there again.  I'm not saying it's abysmal.  But temper your expectations, that's all.","196995":"Wednesday around noon. Came here with my sister. We split the whole ciabatta grilled cheese and each got a cannoli. Food was delicious and filling. I wish the cheese was melted a little bit more. The sandwich was supposed to be a hot sand which but was brought out to us barely warm. It was still delicious though. The cannoli was to die for.","198552":"The restaurant is totally authentic the only thing that I can say about their plates its art, starting from the perfect presentation to the best taste. As they say that when a person is eating he is using all of his senses by smelling the food, listening to it, tasting it, closing your eyes when you enjoy the taste. This is the restaurant that you really want to try if all your senses could function well in.","198983":"Best calzone ever!\n\nYou will not be disappointed. The dough is perfection and not too much ricotta, which I prefer. \n\nAntipasto salad is another fabulous choice. \n\nDefalco's is always consistent. Definitely worth a visit- lunch or dinner.","199170":"We went to Defalco's for my mother's birthday dinner and it was all around scrumptious! I ordered the pesto gnocchi-- delicious! We also ordered a white pizza to share for the table--fabulous and fresh! By far the best Italian food I've had in Arizona.","199263":"I've been here so many times that the staff recognizes us for the frequency in which we buy their tartufo cake,  but I realized I've never written a review. Their food is great (I had their pizza bianca for the first time today, their cheese is amazing), and their chocolate tartufo cake is literally to die for. My boyfriend and I have a strict schedule in which every two weeks we go and pick up some of their amazing cake. The staff is super friendly and the food's not that expensive at all, highly recommend!","199513":"This review is mainly for the customer service, a 2 at best.  The food is delicious and authentic.  DeFalco's lacks more staff and ordering lines for dine-in service during peak times.  This is based on a Saturday at 1:45 PM.  One major issue is the failure to place menus upon entering.  When waiting in line to order, there is easily a 10-15 minute wait just to get to the counter and place the order. We were stuck behind several customers with no knowledge of the menu until they made it to the counter.  Then another 10 minutes to figure out what they wanted.  Meanwhile, the line is out the door, so the deli slicer begins take orders from several customers BEHIND us, cutting the line.  Three line cutters until we spoke up for the actual \"next in line customer\".  While this was going on, we asked our 12 year old to grab a table that was just being cleaned off.  The employee told my son that he couldn't sit there but have no reason.  My husband had to approach the employee and ask and she shrugged her shoulders.  Still clueless why my son was told he could not sit at the table when I saw at least two other adults sitting at the table they grabbed.  Our food was ordered at 2:08 and arrived about 20 minutes later for two subs (1 hot 1 cold).  We enjoyed\u200b the meal but terribly turned off by the lack of customer service.  DeFalco's- I know you can do better.","200422":"The second I landed in Phoenix, this was the first recommendation I received from the locals. I had heard about Defalco's from Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives on Food Network so I knew I had to at least walk into the place. It wasn't until literally the last hour I had a rental car in Phoenix that I was able to stop in. If you've read my review for Kramrcyk's in Minneapolis, MN then you should have guessed that I ABSOLUTELY loved Defalco's! It's just what I was hoping it would be - cozy, inviting, authentic, family-owned, and a personality that could only have evolved through generations of experience.\n\nWhen you first walk in you are greeted by shelves and shelves of Italian goodies and a meat counter. I noticed a very diverse group of customers sitting all around the restaurant section of the store which was a great indicator that the food was likely muy delicioso. I was a little overwhelmed with the menu selection because there were so many items but went with the beef cheesesteak because it was the most yelped about option.\n\nLet me just say that THE CHEESE STEAK DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It probably would have been the best sandwich I have ever had if pickled jalapenos would have been thrown in there. The beef was tender, well seasoned, not too salty, not too bland, just perfect. The mushrooms were grilled long enough to be soft but still have a bite to them. The grilled onions were caramelized and tasted amazing with the melted cheese sauce drizzled on top of the sandwich. The bread was soft, fresh, and not too dense. For a sandwich that was probably 2000 calories, it felt like I had just eaten a light and refreshing meal. \n\nParking is very easy, it's in a strip mall so spaces are ample. Prices are reasonable for a deli and service is fast. \n\nI definitely recommend this place if you find yourself in the greater Phoenix area aka, Scottsdale.","200785":"I forgot how scrumptious this place was while I was on vacation going to spring training baseball games a few years back until the owner was making food on the food channel the other night....Unreal fresh food with large portions,super fresh giant calzone I powered down was the best ever. Lots of places in New York have great Italian food but you can tell each dish here is custom with just the right amount of seasoning and sauce.everything is custom.","201323":"DeFalco's is a quaint little Italian deli & grocery store on North Scottsdale Road near Old Town. I stopped in for a cheesesteak. Frizzled beef, red & green peppers, onions, and mushrooms with white American cheese on a crispy baguette. The rib eye was well seasoned and succulent, not overcooked or greasy. The cheese was melted and mixed throughout, binding the fresh veggies and steak together into a generous portion of warm, gooey goodness. Why 3 stars?\n\nThe crispy baguette ruined it for me. Yes, it was fresh, and in and of itself, a perfectly fine baguette. Nevertheless, not an appropriate platform for a cheesesteak. It's too thick, making the sandwich larger than it needs to be, thus requiring unnecessary effort to bite through. In addition, the crunchy texture is not something normally associated with a cheesesteak. Overall, I would have been happier eating the warm, gooey goodness with a fork and passing on the baguette entirely.\n\nHot sauce would be a nice addition to the condiment selection.","201835":"This is, by far, the best deli in the valley.  Whenever you get the best, you should be prepared to wait.  I make a point of visiting whenever I come home for a visit.  The wait can be anywhere from 15 to 35 minutes, depending upon the time of year so get there early or call ahead to place your order.  Trust me when I say, it's worth it.\n\nDeFalco's uses some of the best meats and cheeses and everything is sliced to order.  Sandwiches range in price from $6 to $7.50 for full sandwiches but 1\/2 sandwiches are available as well.  My favorite is the dried soppressata, capacollo and provolone sandwich; it is the best in my opinion but they have a great reputation for their cheesesteak sandwich.  They have a nice selection of desserts that range from cheesecake and Italian wedding cookies to cannoli and pizzells.       \n\nThey also boast a great selection of Italian grocery items that range from pasta to wine and cheeses to spumoni.  I hear their italian sausage is really good.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and the restaurant is small but clean.  I definitely recommend giving DeFalco's a try.  You wont be disappointed.","202343":"Wonderful combination of restaurant and grocery.  We found table(s) to combine for a party of 9. The staff helped us combine the tables.  We each looked at the menu and decided on a couple of pizzas and pasta dishes to share at the table.  Two of us went to the counter to order the food.\n\nNot long after we placed our order, they delivered the food to our table.  The pizzas were great - one Blanca and one traditional red sauce.  Each entree came with a nice small salad that we shared between 2 people. I really enjoyed the linguine with clam sauce and the gnocchi with pesto.\n\nService is a combination of self-service (get your own soft drinks\/water) and full-service (delivery of food to your table).\n\nDefalco's is a winner in my book - quick, reasonable prices, and great food.","202570":"Best calzones in AZ.\nFantastic wine collection and a huge assortment of antipasto, cheeses, meats and Italian premium foods.\nWill definitely be back to eat there and buy produce there also.\nFantastico!!","203110":"Amazing!  Being from Chicago, I miss good Italian food here but this place is cool.  Has the vibe of a restaurant you'd find in Italy since we were the last fall.  The calzones are ridiculously good.  The arancini ball was the size of the bowl and the spinach \/ cheese was so good.","203701":"Pretty much either my favorite or 2nd favorite place to get a sandwich in Scottsdale. Not to mention you can get a 12 inch sandwich for less than 10 bucks. Place gets packed so make sure you order ahead","204115":"What a great authentic Italian spot. Get groceries, fresh made pasta, or have a sandwich. I go here mostly for the sandwiches, which are the best in town. The meatball sandwich is excellent, but I like to make my own Italian combo sandwich which is superb every time.","204774":"All I can say is overrated. Nothing like good delis on the east coast. I can say their chicken cutlet sandwich is pretty good. You must get it on the crispy baguette with lettuce, onion, tomato, mayo, oil and vinegar, otherwise it's not good. I wish there was a good Italian deli in town!","206051":"Went in for lunch and split a Il Purista and a Calzone.\n\nFIrst off the Il Purista is as good a sandwich as I've had just about anywhere.  I'd come back for this alone and be quite happy to eat nothing else.\n\nWhen the calzone (the small one) arrived I grabbed the plate to put it on the table.  I kid you not the plate had to weigh close to five pounds!  Needless to say more than half the calzone came home.  As far as quality goes, it was good, possibly even great, but I'm actually more fond of ordering calzones (I think it has something to do with Seinfeld) than actually eating them.\n\nWe got there just before the lunch rush.  Within 15 minutes of our arrival half of Scottsdale piled into the place.  Food is good but plan accordingly.","206093":"The chicken parm and lasagna were delicious but the cannoli was to die for.  It was the best cannoli I've had some I left NYC. and even then it's top 5. Prices are reasonable too!","206471":"Love, love, love this deli in my neighborhood.  The authentic selection is amazing, I usually get the Italian sub and rarely wandered.  However, when we saw one of the pizza's being set out a couple of weeks ago we just had to try it.  Got a 16\" to go and it was amazing.  My boyfriend actually said this might be his favorite pizza place now (he's an aficionado).","207815":"Delicious food to order and a variety of pastas, sauces to buy for a homemade Italian feast. I could spend hours looking at their products from Italy like olive oil, canned sauces, and other delicacies you don't find in the grocery stores.","207941":"an old chainsmoking gal that i worked with years ago said if i wanted \"real\" italian food i had to go here. my chef boyardee was going to have to wait next to the \"tony's pizza until gloria showed me the errors of my culinary ways. fazoli's was my  idea of great italian food at that time\ndefalcos was in the old location then and i think much smaller than the current version. not better or worse, just seemed more homey. foods awesome, service is good, ambiance is diminished from the og locale i think. i always get the same eggplant parm sandwich so don't expect an entire menu rehash. support the locally owned shops..they usually work harder and longer to make our food and actually care about the quality..thank you gloria, you chainsmoking old broad..for the suggestion..for the secondary smoke and great conversations...between your coughing fits.","208699":"True 5 star deli. Big menu of classics and Italian delicacies. If you leave hungry it is your own fault.","209009":"This is my favorite place, best pizza, the spinach salad with chicken is amazing\n\nI usually come here once or twice a week. I like that I'm able to call in the order and 15 mins later I can pick it up.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and knows me by name. If you like Italian food I recommend you trying this place.","209483":"I hit this place up for lunch on a fairly frequent basis, awesome Italian beef sandwich and a great Deli feel with authentic Italian grocery items.  Also one cool thing about this place is they make homemade pizza dough everyday that you can buy to take home and make your own pie.","211328":"Great smells! Amazing food!  Good service!   Just wish that the employees were more into the culture of the food like when out east!  Missing atmosphere thats for sure, but the food is great!","211714":"If you're not getting OG Italian sandwiches from here you are surely missing out! A little deli restaurant inside a small grocery full of Italian goodies. Everything they make is handmade, and you can even buy their wide variety of desserts and gelatos to go. Very busy around meal times but if you call ahead they will have your food ready pronto!","211733":"My mom and I stopped in at a weird off-time: a Monday afternoon around 2pm. About half the tables at the deli were occupied, which hints at how well-liked this place is! The young gentleman at the counter was very pleasant and acknowledged our presence right away. We ordered a roast portobello sandwich on sourdough, a cannolo, and a latte to go. All were DELICIOUS. The sandwich was hot, fresh, and flavorful; the latte was very tasty, not bitter; and the cannolo was excellent. We had a look around the grocery while we waited. Nice little place, and unlike other reviewers, we had lovely service. It's out of our way, but we'll definitely come back. Makes me happy to shop small\/non-franchised businesses like this one!","212974":"On the show Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and they make the sausage themselves! Best pasta ive had and great tasting pastrami sandwiches and cheesecake yumm","213673":"Wow! The food is great.  I am in love with the Calzone here, but I've had a number of other things in the past and have never been displeased.  In addition, these guys have a beer selection that rivals most grocery stores.","214488":"I was going to be in Scottsdale today, and just happen to see an episode of triple D on DeFalcos, I went and I wasn't disappointed!  A real Italian deli.  It reminded me of Roma Imports in Tucson.  I took a calzone home with veggies and pepperoni.  The combination of mozzarella and ricotta cheese was unbelievable!  So stringy, and had the right combo of oils on it.  The pepperoni was the thin real Italian kind - all AMAZING.  They had a cute little market with good wine, and I found some canned clams that are hard for me to find.  I also bought some imported Italian pizza sauce for my next homemade pizza. The calzone took about 15 minutes, but the wait was worth it!","214682":"I moved to this part of town a month ago, I'm from NY and Italian. I was so happy when I first walked into Delfalcos and could smell the sause, cheese and garlic. They even sell pizza dough for my stombolli! I haven't seen a real Italian style deli since I left NY 14 years ago so I was thrilled. Their calzone was great.  So far I have been there 3 times, I have also ordered their hero sandwiches, the bread is great.  Unfortunately on a recent Friday night I had the worst service, bad enough to keep me away. Since I know that the wait is long once you place your order, I have yet to wait less than a 1\/2 hour, I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 45 minutes. I ordered a calzone and meatball parm hero. I arrived 45 minutes later. My meatball hero was ready but the calzone was not.  I don't think they ever started it. After waiting another 1\/2 hour A \"gentleman\" came to the register to present the bill and tell me it would be another 5 minutes or so, I asked if the sandwich that had been sitting on the counter the entire time was mine, he said yes.  I was not happy with the prospect of my meatballs and cheese sitting there to get cold while I waited for my calzone, so I asked if he was going to give me a fresh sandwich, If looks could kill...I was subjected to the rudest of service from that point forward.  A customer next to me commented \"good for you\" he said he never gets good service there but the food is good. At no time did the \"gentleman\" apologize or seem to care if I was satisfied. A real detriment to any business in this economy is someone who represents your business so poorly.  Maybe I will return, some day....","214995":"You should go to Defalco's if any of the following apply to you:\n\n1. You have been to Italy before and you want to relive that Italian food adventure but not leaving the confines of South Scottsdale\n2. You want to have some of the best Italian Beef or Philly Cheesteaks sandwiches you have ever had. \n3. You are in no rush for your meal\n\nI have been to Defalco's over 15 times while leaving in Phoenix. Their food is superb, the staff is friendly and the experience is always consistent. The only glaring problem, which they address with a sign on their front door, is it takes FOREVER. \n\nThis is the closest you are going to get to an Authentic Italian Delicatessen in Phoenix.  The food while eating there is delicious but I would also suggest having them set you up with a Pizza Kit so you can make authentic Italian pizza at home. It is delicious easy and very affordable. \n\nHowever if you are a cheesesteak lover and you go to Defalco's and don't order it is a sin. It is a huge hot messy mouth watering I can't believe I finally found such a delicious sandwich. \n\nThe portions are huge so keep that in mind and it's not the cheapest or quickest place. But it is the BEST Italian Deli I have been to in PHX.","215133":"I realized that I have been coming to Defalcos for the last 15 years and never raved about this place.  This has got to be by far the best Italian Deli in the entire Phoenix area.  The food is authentic and Delicious.  The pasta dishes are just like grandma Taormina used to make.   The sandwiches are excellent.  Don't forget the desserts.  Cannolis and cookies are perfect.  You can't go wrong here!","215488":"Defalco's is half sandwich place, half italian grocery, full on tasty tasty italian flavor.\n\nI took an Arizona native here because he had never heard of it before (gasp!) even thought I believe it has several locations over Tempe-Scottsdale area. The guy at the counter suggested I try any of the hot sandwiches as they, in his opinion, have more flavor than the cold ones.\n\nI ordered a full (also available in half, but really who would ever do that) sub with sausage and peppers. The sausage is made in-house and tasted super fresh. The peppers and onions are soft and well-cooked and the toppings are swimming in a sea of marinara sauce (which is also made in house). \n\nNow the real challenge is eating it. Or, eating it without looking like a murder victim in a crime scene. I had marinara sauce in my elbows, ears, nose and any available crevice you can think of get your mind out of the gutter already). Everything came piping hot and it was incredibly filling at around $7. Score.\n\nNow on my way out I made the horrible (cough wonderful) mistake of passing by their dessert display and purchased a giant piece of caramel topped NY cheesecake (to go). I was like \"Oh ill put it in the fridge and we can all share it tomorrow or something\". Lies. When they all left to watch a movie (~3hrs later) I took a fork and starting nomming the creamy, thick, delicious cheesecake from Defalcos. \"I'll never finish it\" I thought. 30 minutes later I was starring at an empty piece of Styrofoam, with the guilt of the world on my shoulders. Damn was that cheesecake good, but I had a lot of explaining to do when the boys came home.\n\nWhatever. It was worth it.","215925":"Saw this on Guy Fieris Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and I was impressed by the food and wine selection-and for low prices. The sausage was very good, so dig in to the sandwiches and pastas! However, it gets a four star because the tables were a bit dirty and the atmosphere was a little bland. But, enjoy the food!","216235":"I haven't had a carb since 2004. The other day I decided I would try something new and have a bowl of spaghetti. I am sooooo glad I chose Defalco's to break the streak.  The pasta was incredibly satisfying and the meatball was the best I've had in recent memory.  I can't wait to go back in 7 years to try one of their sandwiches.","217019":"Friendly staff and fairly good food.  My benchmark has always been a hot beef sandwich with hot peppers and ajus.  It was ok here but did not match to the Chicago Hamburger Company's on Indian School or Miracle Mile on 16th street.","217986":"This food was amazing!!!!!!!! all together we ordered the chicken alfredo, the the purista, and a turkey & provolone. The place is clean, the girl at the register was kinda bitchy though, she walked away from me mid-order and was rude, so I would definitely work on her customer service skills. She was really short, and for 3 people who were first time customers, she left a sour taste, and she forgot my moms black and white cookie. Also the soda machine was all out of syrup. But the store itself is wonderful, and the food was great. I would have given 5 if she wasnt so rude.","218402":"Such a cute authentic Italian experience!! And the pizza was amazing! I loved the patio experience and the weather was perfect! I would recommend to anyone!!","219460":"There is no place better than Defalco's. Everyone I know loves this place and righfully so. Their sandwiches are killer, the side dishes are all so fresh and taste like something out of Grandma's kitchen. I am a huge fan and I cannot wait for many more delicious meals from Defalco's!","219595":"Great little deli dine in martket.  I come here for a sandwhich or sub that's truly unique.  Yea you can hit up subway but ewwww!!!!  This place serves up some mouth watering examples of a proscuitto sub or eggplant parm that are STELLAR!!!  If you're a kitchen pro or a mad scientist their choice of ingredients in the market are inspiring for the next set of recipes!  Though the hours are a bit brief whenever you can catch this place open you'll be more than happy that you did.  Always a great suggestion for first timers and I'll definately be back for more!","221138":"This place is consistently good. I'm pretty sure over the last 10 years I've had almost everything on their menu.  The guys are great, service is always with a smile. If you go during weekday lunch expect a bit of wait but know it will be well worth it. My favorite is a classic hard salami with provolone.","221397":"While visiting Scottsdale,AZ., looking for a good Italian deli I found this place. It has. great reviews so thought I'd give it try. I ordered a small pizza cheese pepperoni and Italian sausage. The pizza is huge and priced good($12.95). It took a while to get it ready(30 min.) The dining area was packed so I decided to sit outside in the patio. The person delivering the pizza to just dropped it off didn't bother to ask if I needed anything else, LIKE NAPKINS!! When I chased him down and asked, he said \"go to that counter and ask him\" WOW that was rude. \nAnyway, pizza is good not awesome or anything but pretty good. \n Don't know if I could recommend this place to friends based on that \"RUDE\" person. \nMaybe get some nice friendly waiters or waitresses?","221880":"Thank you fellow Yelpers. You did not steer me wrong here. Food was good and price, well that was amazing considering how yummy it was! The atmosphere is fun too. I liked the little Italian grocery store. Wish I had taken more time to browse it, maybe could have taken some of the nom nom goodness home with me. Better yet, could have impressed the wife!.. Who doesn't know I ate here since it was a fun casual business lunch. ...Did I already tell you it didn't break the bank? I mean if you are going to pay for lunch, which I did, then pick this place! ..Hope Mat and Arnie don't read that. \n\nCheck it out already! \n\nDid you really just read that entire review? Well if you did read this and you did enjoy the awesomeness of Defalco's then I would appreciate one of those nifty little icons below. Clicked -click.","222922":"One may ask why when in Arizona would you want to eat Italian food...being from the east coast there are plenty of good Italian eateries. This place is unique and fun...the food is great. And you can buy wine to go with it. Strictly casual...you stand in line to place your order, and then someone comes looking for you to give you the order. Hubs and I sat outside sipping an Oregon Pinot and enjoying the warm weather as we waited for our food. Food came, he got cheese steak and I got eggplant park.  All was delish and enjoyable. Very relaxing too.  Def would go back.","223914":"REVIEW 600!!!   YES!!!!!!!!  HOORAY FOR ME!!!\n\nI swear I have eaten here before, but not in AGES.  I came here last night because I was on this side of town, and it brought back a few memories of years past when I first moved here.\n\nFor starters, this place is cute, and has a lot going for them.  Set up as part grocery, part restaurant, its in a strip mall on Scottsdale road near Thomas.  Hours are great, and menu is large with great pricing.  I love a good menu! You can basically get just about anything you want done your way here, and the food is pretty good.\n\nFor starters, the wait was a bit longer then I had anticipated, and I thought it would have moved a lot quicker considering I was here at 8:30 on a Wednesday night. There was hardly anyone in here!  I thought it was just an off night, but after reading other reviews, I guess their a little slow on service.  I don't mean to sound impatient, but the wait did seem long and I was quite hungry.\n\nSecondly, the grocery store was well stocked, but some of the shelving seemed a bit tired. I was sitting there waiting for my food and noticed that some of the shelves with heavier cans on them were starting to buckle and warp.  Maybe it's time to upgrade?  Nothing is perfect, but it kind of made me feel tired after I sat there staring off at random things in the place while waiting for my food.\n\nOn a more positive note, the food is delicious!  You can get anything you want made up any way you like.  I went with a half tuna sandwich and I couldn't finish the darned thing!  Great awesome pricing with a large menu and a great concept here.\n\nAlso, while I was here waiting, I overheard a customer talking with one of the staff members. I guess Guy Fieri stopped in here recently for Diners, drive ins and dives.  I also saw a huge poster of him on the wall by the customer pick up area.  10,000 bonus points for that!!!\n\nOverall, place is great, but I feel like they need to move a little quicker in the back with food preparation, and work on stepping up some of the grocery shelves to make it look less tired.  Great product selection not only in the grocery area, but menu as well.  Definitely worthwhile, just don't expect your food to quickly and be prepared to wait a bit...","224704":"I recently moved to Scottsdale and had never been to Defalco's. My husband had been here a couple of time's before. We decided on a Sunday evening to get pizza and my husband suggested we go to Defalco's. We ordered a margerhita pizza. It was seriously the best pizza I've ever had. We had leftovers which I ate for lunch the following day and they were just as awesome. I will definitely be back!!!","224936":"Back again for a sandwich lunch.  I ordered a full meatball sandwich, and my wife had a full chicken parm sandwich, both loaded with their wonderful marinara sauce, and more than enough meat.  We could only eat half a sandwich each, and so a great sandwich was born unto breakfast the next day!  New bread of course.  AS usual, their sandwiches were served on wide, toasted sub rolls, adding another layer of flavor, and chew.  We got there at 12:45 and by 1PM it was packed again, the second wave of lunch goers! Service was very slow and I had to go up to the counter to get napkins and knives and forks, another wait.  Too bad the service didn't match the quality and taste of the food. Perhaps another time, when it would be less crowded.","225182":"What can I possibly say? \nEverything they serve there is wonderful. \nThe selection in their little grocery section is inspirational. Even when I go with a list, I end up with a dozen things I didn't know I needed at home for my pantry. \nThey have amazing prosciutto. \nIf you are a foodie, this is one fun place.","225938":"Lets be honest, the seating arrangement sucks bad, but I'll eat here any chance I get. Good grinds, I'll be back.","226037":"My coworkers and I came here for lunch, and I called with our order the night before (I was told it gets really busy during lunch, so that's a big timesaver). It took a little while for the guy at the pickup order to find our order and ring us up, so it wasn't too timely. We probably had to wait 15 minutes to get the food after paying for it. \n\nThe outdoor seating area was nice, and the food was good too. I was allergic to most of the menu, but it was my coworker's birthday pick so I had to make it work. My order was essentially the Ceaser salad minus the Ceasar dressing and cheese (basically lettuce + olives + grilled chicken + olive oil\/balsamic vinegar). It was surprisingly super tasty. How do they pack so much flavor into grilled chicken?!","227008":"Got their eggplant parmigiana spaghetti! To die for! Very chill and calm place to have a sit down lunch or semi romantic dinner. Their cheese lasagna is also really good! A must try for sure!","227233":"Get the PESTO philly cheese steak amazing.  Sounds wierd and gross but not!  Their pizza is really good too.  You can't go wrong here.  I would suggest calling in your order.  I do that all the time and you can still eat it there.  If you go to eat in, it takes time.  You are not at Mcdonalds.","227280":"Arguably the best pizza in town.  \n\nSo much care is put into the each ingredient to make sure they provide a high quality product.  Thick mozzarella, zesty pizza sauce, crispy\/chewy crust, & fresh toppings.  \n\nThe wine selection, deli, desserts, & grocery offerings provide a nice distraction while you wait for you order.  \n\nTheir staff is cheerful, friendly, and eager to help.  All around great experience.","227452":"We had been going to the chinese place in the same parking lot for a month or two, and I had been meaning to give this place a try... And holy crap, I think I have a new favorite place to eat lunch.\n\nThe first visit, we asked the guy at the register what would be good for a first-timer to try, and he said the Philly Cheese Steak is the best in AZ.  So I had that, and I don't know if it's better than a Corleone's cheese steak, but it was definitely good, and certainly priced much better.\n\nVisit #2, I went with a half plate of the meat lasagna.  Delicious.  The sauce is flavorful, and the half plate, which comes with a side of garlic toast, is more than enough food.  \n\nVisit #3, I had the half chicken parmigiana sandwich and a slice of new york cheesecake.  The sandwich was saucy, cheesy, and all around great.  The cheesecake was probably a B+... Not quite what you get at, say, the Carnegie Deli, but nothing to scoff at.\n\nThere is all kinds of other crap on the menu that will bring you back for many visits.  A colleague had Il Purista sandwich, with homemade mozzarella, panscetta, among other things.  The counter is rife with delicious looking salads and desserts, and there are countless sandwiches and pastas.  There is even pizza, which I haven't even delved into yet.\n\nThe best part is the price.  You can generally get out of there with a $10 or so lunch, and considering the quality of the food, it's a very good price.\n\nI could eat here every day.","227543":"The key to Defalcos is calling IN your order before arriving.  This place is awesome but its SWAMPED at lunch time.  You'll end up eating your lunch for dinner if you dont plan accordingly.  \n\nThey make fresh sandwhiches and salads and I've never had an \"off\" meal there.  Try something Itialian...its what they do best, my favorite its the meatball sub.  Also the antipasto salad ranks right on up there.\n\nIn the grocery section, you'll find specialty items to take home... homemade pastas, spices etc.  Delicious!!","228584":"Not sure what has happened recently, but quality and consistency are sorted lackly of late. We had the Italian beef sandwhich many times for lunch  and it has been the standard to which we compare others....tender, well seasoned beef, thinly sliced grilled onions (we don't like peppers so omit then) - delicious!!! Tonight we ordered some to go for dinner they erre plain awful. Beef was chewy and tough, and \"light\" onions somehow translated to big chunks of not well cooked onion slapped on top of the meat. If we stayed at the store to eat, we would have sent them back.  Even the best place going to have a bad night but the last few times the customer service has been poor also. Tonight the person behind the deli counter told several customers how busy he was and how he had been dealing with catering orders all day. The line was long, so politely keeping it moving would have been nice - like a lady behind me commented- everybody in line had a busy day too... Disappointed in the food, further disappointed in the service. Hope they get back on track.","228642":"Ahhh love this place. Walked in and instantly felt like i was home in a brooklyn deli. Calxones are bomb! Good fountain drinks. I even bought great quality groceries. Thanks Defalco for a great dinner.","229467":"Classic Italian style local deli , check out the meatball\/parm, really good cheese and really good bread. Yum.","229775":"I walked in for someone else one day and I wanted to try it because of how cool the place looked. I finally tried it with the in laws last night and it was phenomenal! Would definitely recommend to anyone","229904":"If you've never been to Italy, don't panic- you can go to DeFalco's and taste the real taste of Italy in the middle of gross AZ. Everything is absolutely authentic, legit Italian. Homemade tomato sauce, pasta, pizza- you name it. Even the owners are homemade Italians, if you know what I mean. You can also purchase Italian-style groceries (pasta, sauce, wine) so you can take home to cook and pretend you are a cool Italian. \n\nI recommend the ravioli if you have even an ounce of attraction for ricotta cheese.","230231":"This place is great! Expect to wait in line during lunch hour, but the time does move fast. I've had their turkey and meatball sub, and have no complaints. They also have a great selection of wines.","230377":"Went with mom, son and sister and it was great. Had 2 cheese steaks, greek salad, and egg plant parmesan samdwich.  All of it was good, but cheese steak is one if not the best ive ever had. I got mine with everything mushrooms, onion, and res and green bell peppers.  Bread was perfect and the sandwich was juicy and cheese all gooey and melted not stringy.  Great place to go. Constant stream of folks on mothers day Sunday.\nYou walk up to cashier place order and you  put the number on your table, get drinks and wait, so service is pretty quick.  Will have to save room for desert next time.","231781":"Great sandwiches at reasonable prices. The bread is good, the au jus was flavorful and not too salty, and the sausages are made daily.  It was nice to find a place to get great sandwiches. The line moves a little slow, but it's definitely worth the wait. I had the italian beef and my friend had the sausage, both were great.","232265":"Small deli serving up some delicious sandwiches!  The pizza sub is awesome! (I like to add green peppers and mushrooms)\nThey serve beer as well so you can have a cold one with your lunch.  \nAlso have a stock of specialty Italian foods like your jarred veggies etc.","233790":"Put the meatball sandwich in your mouth. Right now. You won't regret it. I swear. \nMeatball pizza, put it in your mouth. Grilled portobello mushroom sandwich on focaccia bread... That should go in your mouth too. And while your at, put the lemon bars in there.  So good. Please listen to me. If I could give DeFalcos 10 stars, I'd give them 12.","234270":"The fiance was craving cheese steaks and our local burger\/sandwich joint is closed on Sundays. So, we decided to try out DeFalco's. Reading the reviews, I saw that the wait time is sometimes an issue, so I called in our order in advance. The order consisted of 1 whole cheese steak w\/ everything and 1 half w\/ everything. \n \nUpon arrival, I was given the total of $21 and some change. Having seen the online menu with pricing, I was prepared for the bill to be somewhere around $15, so I was a little shocked when I was told it was over $20. I verified the order with the man and found that I was charged for and made one extra whole sandwich. I told the cashier that the order was incorrect, to which he said \"I was the one who took the phone order and it was for 2 whole and 1 half sandwiches.\" He proceeded to grab the order slip and show me. I replied, \"Well, I'm the person who called in the order and specifically asked for 1 whole for my finance and 1 half for myself.\" He stood there after my explanation as if expecting me to pay for the additional sandwich. After he realized that I was not going to pay for his mistake, he took the second whole sandwich back and rerang the bill. The new total came to $13.00+ tax, an amount within the range I was expecting to pay. \n \nEven though the sandwiches were delicious, we are hesitant to return. We may try DeFalco's again, only next time as walk-in customers","235369":"I want to start this out by saying that this was my first time at DeFalcos and I will definitely be going back. So that's always a good sign.\n\nI got there right before the lunch rush so I didn't have to wait at all to order. I ordered the Italian sausage hot sandwich with peppers and onions and my boyfriend got the steak and cheese hot sandwich.\n\nWe ordered to-go so we had some time to poke around in the grocery part of the store while waiting for our order. Mostly the wines and olive oils which looked like a good selection.\n\nIt took about 10 minutes for the order to be ready. It seemed like a lot of people call in their orders ahead of time (note to self.) \n\nThe sandwiches were pretty amazing. I'm actually not usually the biggest fan of sausage but since this place is known for it I wanted to try it. If this is what sausages are meant to taste like I feel like I've been missing out my whole life. It was impossibly moist and flavorful. It didn't taste too \"sausage-y\". I don't know if that will make sense to anyone else, but the \"sausage-y-ness\" is what I dislike about most sausages. It was topped with their red sauce which was wonderful and the Italian sub roll was perfect.\n\nI'll be back for pizza and desserts.","235875":"OMG. I found Italian bread in Scottsdale.  I found a Jersey-style Italian Hoagie. (they didn't follow my exact phone directions but I am so forgiving as it was like being home). The pizza was okay as well. Tried a saled, no complaints. Pepper sandwich, great.  Tarimisu second only to Sals. And my friend ordered some Baklava which was fresh and flaky. I can pick up all my Italian cheeses and always find something I want to try.  They should perfect their phone orders better, but otherwise, it's like being in Jersey.","236393":"This place is authentic and awesome! Best Italian I've ever had. Large petition sizes. The calzones, meatball subs, and baked ziti were amazing!","237243":"I haven't ever really shopped here as a market- but have eaten here a decent amount as a deli\/restaurant. It is not only pretty authentic Italian cuisine- but the ingredients are fresh and you can taste it. Their handmade dishes like pasta or their hot sandwiches are to die for. The sauces are rich, the portions huge, and the flavor is out of this world. The price definitely points to the quality- and I'm happy to pay a little more than average for outstanding food. Their desserts and pastries are very rich and heavy- you can tell everything is made from scratch! I'd recommend trying the gnocchi with Alfredo sauce or one of their cannolis- those are a few of my favorites here.","237396":"My new favorite place in Phoenix! Great quality food for a reasonable price. Delicious and I can't wait to bring my family here!","237504":"Great food and prices are very fair with the amount of food you get.  Everything there is really good.  IMO best pizza in AZ.\nPizza and Pasta are my favorites but can't go wrong with any of the food there.","237597":"My friend actually wanted to really go here because this was this restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. We were also recommended by the hospital staff at Scottsdale HonorHealth. \n\nThey were definitely not kidding when they said that you would be eating in between rows of Italian grocery shelves! I thought we were in the wrong place at first. Again, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat because the menu was pretty expansive, but settled on my usual calzones whenever I try out new Italian restaurants. The calzone comes in two sizes, 10\" or 16\", and you can either choose your own toppings or buy their calzone concoction. You choose your toppings (or stuffings) from the pizza toppings which are like $1.50 each. My total which a drink ended up being about $17... Holy crap! But there is a big reason why it was so much, IT WAS HUGE!! I ended up just eating half of it and taking the rest back to the hotel for lunch tomorrow. The calzone was good, but not really something I would crave. I think I'd like to come back for another meal on the menu because it was not too terrible of a place.","238149":"This was my second time this week to experience DeFalco's. To say I was underwhelmed both times would be an understatement.\n\nThe first time was when we ordered pizza for friends that were coming over for the evening. Our friends were excited because DeFalco's was a place they had heard really great things about and couldn't wait to try their food. the pizza though was just so-so. The sausage and pepperoni one was better than the vegetarian one because the meat added some flavor to the whole thing but the veggie one was bland. No one was impressed...\n\nMy dad has been going here for years though and he said their sandwiches are what they are famous for so I forgave the sub-par pizza and tonight we decided to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm sorry that we did...\n\n1. I don't have a problem with surly restaurant employees... I was a surly barista for years but I have a problem with rude asshole workers. My husband and I walked up to the counter and this guy turns and complains to his co-worker about all the people coming in. Really dude??? People buying food here is what keeps you employed! He then bitches again about the same thing as I am attempting to order. AND he won't even acknowledge that I am the one ordering and will only make eye contact with my husband. Like I wasn't there. \n\n2. My husband ordered the Greek Veggie Sandwich. We got home with the sandwich and as he was checking it out he notices that it has only one piece of feta on the whole 12 inch sandwich. And one cherry tomato on each sandwich half. The rest of it is just cucumber and onions. That's it. So he was essentially given a cucumber sandwich. Lame.\n\n3. My dad and I split a whole Combo sandwich. It was okay. Not great. I've had better sub sandwiches.  My dad says that the sandwiches were not like he remembered in the past and that this time they really seemed to skimp on the meat. In the past he and his girlfriend had split the same sandwich and it was almost too much for them both. That was not the case tonight. \n\nThe only positive thing I have to say is that one of the people with us got a tuna sandwich and they said it was really great. She also thinks Top Ramon is good though so take her review as you wish.\n\nSorry to say that I don't think I will visiting this establishment again. And my friends that wanted to try the sandwiches... I'll be encouraging them not to bother.","238794":"OMG, what a find!  Food is swoon-worthy... literally!  One of our party is a New Yorker, and said it was as good as any she's had.  The prices are very reasonable.  The wait for the food, whether at the sandwich counter, the grocery deli, or for the sit-down meals, is SOOOO worth it!","239074":"Absolutely the best eggplant parmigiana sandwich I've ever had -- and I grew up in New York City. The cold cuts are absolutely top drawer. Thought I'd wandered into a deli in Brooklyn. They even have Dr Brown's soda at a REASONABLE ($1.39) price!!","239121":"Really liked this little gem.  Good food very reasonable prices.  Only downside is their process to order is ridiculous.  Waited in line for over 20 minute to place our order.  After that food was fast enough but man get another cashier or some help there.","239480":"YUMMY!!!  I have only had delicious and fresh food from DeFalco's....and I have been a customer for the last 5 years!!  Great food, friendly staff.  Just a heads up...because the food is so good...they can tend to have a long line and you may wait for your food for a while.  They even have a sign up that states if you have don't have 15 mins to spare to wait for your food...you may not to make other lunch arrangements.....and it is true. My advice..... If you're in a rush, call in, they will take phone orders.","239918":"DeFalco's is now one of my favorites! My friend and I stumbled upon it through yelp and I am so glad we did!  The staff was friendly, as well as the other customers, when they found out it was our first time. We got a little too excited and ordered the margherita pizza, chicken parm sandwich, and Te antipasto salad. It was all so good!  We didn't finish it all, but then all the desserts looked so good, so we got some biscotti, canolis, and an eclair. \n\nSince then, I've been back to try the white pizza. It was good, but I still end up back with the margherita. \n\nMy only gripe is how tight the seating is. If it's busy, it's hard to find a seat, but you just gotta be ready to swoop in and grab a table if someone leaves!","240716":"Amazing Italian sandwich!   Loved the side salads.   The Italian grocery was heavenly.   You must try it!","241225":"Interesting concept - dining within a market. You order your food at the counter and once you find a table your order is brought out to you. Friendly employees, efficient service, quirky concept, good food, decent prices and wine. \nWhat more could you ask for? My party tasted the meatball sub, cheese ravioli, veggie sub and pizza. All very tasty. \nShopping after eating - it's a win\/win. Great location in South Scottsdale with ample parking. I'll be back to try the fettuccine  alfredo. Heard good things about it.","241349":"My Family and I have been going to Defalco's since I was a little girl! The quality of their food is amazing and has been for years! You can never beat a delicious Italian sub, pasta, or even pizza from Defalco's!","241465":"I went here with my buddy and I ate a meatball sandwich. The quality was not bad, nor exceptional. It was a substantial amount of food. My buddy had the trio sandwich, I believe. He didn't have a ton to add to the contrary about his sandwich, which was also middle-of-the-road. He sang the praised for the cheese steak sandwich however and the pizza pictures look phenomenal.\n\nI personally would have ordered the calzone but the base was 6 something with an additional $2 for each topping.\n\nWith the two sandwiches and drinks I believe the total was around 15-17 dollars. I would go back to try something else, but I wouldn't go here specifically for a meatball sandwich.\n\nTheir call-ahead service was helpful as the line was fairly long by the time we got there. The food was ready and the service was prompt. I would suggest this if you are in a hurry for lunch.","241684":"AMAZING. The white pizza, cheesesteak (chicken & beef), & deli sandwiches are great. I've never been disappointed. Expect to wait awhile sometimes, as this place gets busy! Well worth the wait though.","241838":"Delfalco's is amazing, everything you eat is  burst of flavor invading your taste buds. This is my go to place for the best Italian food in the valley.  Sei il migliore! :)","242006":"What a great place, they have just about everything Italian when it comes to food. You can even buy a ball of just made pizza dough. They even have Lupini, if you know what that is, you are Italian. Fun just walking around the place and looking at all the stuff they have. Then there is the deli. While waiting for my pizza I stood and watched the items coming out of the kitchen. I wanted to take a bite from each of them. Everything looked just great. Got a pizza to go, the only problem was that traffic was heavy and it took me 40 minutes to get home.  I wanted to grab a slice from the box while driving but I just could not manage it as the slices were quite big and I think it would have ended up in my lap rather than my mouth. Even though it was a bit cold it was still quite good, great crust, nice sauce, cheese could have been spread a bit rather than just big slices placed on top. A bit light on the mushrooms, tasty pepperoni, but all and all a pizza I would return for. I only wish it was closer, if it was, I would be there several times a week.","242150":"This place is amazing! If your are in the mood for great Italian food this is the place to go. It is a very small dining area but also has a patio. They sell many Italian ingredients so when you walk in it almost feels like a store. They have amazing sandwiches, pizzas, salads, and deserts. This is my go to! You won't be disappointed.","242677":"The best Italian deli in the Phoenix metro area hands down.  Incredible value.","242837":"The Salted Carmel gelato is a must! Do yourself a favor and take a ride on the magical euphoria train with each delicious bite!","243703":"An excellent place to grab lunch with food ranging from hot and cold sandwiches to pizza and lasagne. On this particular trip I had the hot Italian beef sandwich along with the anti pasta salad. The food was excellent as usual. I also bought some fresh pizza dough, pizza sauce and fresh made mozzarella for pizza night. All in all a top notch place to grab a bite to eat!","243818":"WOW!! Must start off with this was the best lemon bar I have ever had. Absolutely delicious! \n\nThis was my first time trying Defalco's after hearing excellent things from friends and reading the reviews. I got a half order gnocchi with tomato sauce to go (still had leftovers) and it was excellent as well. I definitely will be back!","243973":"A beautiful piece of Italian heaven!  The food speaks for itself!","244340":"I can't believe Dave B's crumby review. What a troll. DeFalco's is consistently delicious. Dave B... I hope your silly hat blows off the next time you put the top down on your Miata.\n\nI have explored the menu, and enjoyed everything I have tried. My go to menu item is the Chicken Pesto Sandwich. DeFalco's nails it every time.","244398":"Best Pizza, Best Philly Cheese Steak!!!!! This place is just the bomb!!!!!!!!","245726":"Found this place 5 years ago while searching for a deli with my friend and have been coming back ever since!\n\nHands DOWN the best deli in the Valley. Possibly in all of AZ. A real taste of NYC and worth any sort of wait (not that bad except for lunch).\n\nI recommend any italian cold cut, Meatball sub,Turkey or chicken parm\n\nHave yet to try the pizza but i would assume it's bomb-diggity!\n\nOH I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE CANOLLI! \n\nyou can tell this place excites me!","246578":"After reading all of the positive comments about this place I thought it would be fun to try with the family.  I have to say I was truly disappointed.  The pizza had little or no sauce, the chicken parm sandwich was very dry and I had asked for extra sauce but it still came out dry.  The fettuccine alfredo was actually very tasty, but the spaghetti and meatballs was not good at all, very overdone and burnt tasting.  Overall I cannot recommend this restaurant, although they do have quite a nice selection of italian groceries.","246701":"A pleasant surprise! I'm so excited to find an Italian spot that I love! The salad, pizza, and cheesecake were ALL so delicious! The best part is it's not far from my house.. we will definitely make this our go to spot for pizza! Unfortunately I don't have any pictures to share, because I was too busy eating! Next time!","246864":"Every time we come here, we have an awful experience. We love the food, it's good quality and tastes amazing, but the service honestly is awful. Our order is almost always wrong that we now check our food before even leaving the parking lot just to find out that it's yet again made wrong, or missing items and we have to go back in. \n\nThe cold sandwiches say they come with mayo, mustard AND Italian dressing. But both our sandwiches came with none of the above. On my veggie americano I asked for no avocado, no cucumber, and extra sprouts, but for some reason don't have green bell peppers on my sandwich either(which it says it comes with as well). Lacking mayo mustard, Italian dressing and bell peppers.\n\nVery disappointed every time which is why we only come here once every 6 months. Please fix this as we love your food, but are tired of being let down!","247129":"I have been craving for pizza for awhile now, so my friends and I finally decided on defalco's for their Italian food. It was a right choice. :) \n\nQuick tip: I was rather confused in terms of how to order at first because it was a grocery store and a restaurant at the same time. Unlike the others, they have tables and chairs between the aisles so there isn't really a clear separation between the grocery store and the restaurant itself. Once you enter, you can just go ahead and stand in line to order, then find a table afterwards. Think of it as getting a sandwich from Safeway! \n\nI ordered the II Purista since almost everyone on Yelp recommended it. There is a variety of bread you can choose from, like marble rye, sour dough, and wheat, etc.  I ordered the crispy baguette to go along with it. The sandwich was very fresh and the mozzarella cheese in it was very spongy! It was good and I'm so proud of myself for getting it. \n\nMy two other friends ordered the calzone and the pizza margherita. I didn't get to try the calzone because it looked huge and stuffed with cheese. It's just like a pizza folded in half. I knew I was going to get sick if I ate that, so no thank you. However, the pizza was PHENOMENAL! My friend says in order to know if an italian restaurant is really good, he always order the most basic margherita to test it out. It didn't disappoint. The basil leaves were super fresh. It was great!!!","247475":"Recently moved to Scottsdale. My cousin was in town couple weeks ago and we gave this place a try.  Why Italian? I don't know. It was his idea. And we look Italian, but we're not. So go figure... \n\nAnyways, the food was amazing. I've had lots of Italian sandwiches but the ones we ordered were delicious. I got the regular cold Italian Sandwich. The bread was fresh and not too hard. We also go the meatball sandwich which was great too. \n\nThe guy was telling us that his store was going to be on TV pretty soon, or it was (I can't remember). Regardless, they deserve it. Good quality food.","247497":"Sooooo happy to have found this gem!!! Authentic Italian food with a first class deli. Everything is extremely fresh and delicious! We stopped in for a pizza one night. We had the PIZZA BIANCA with pepperoni and mushrooms. Literally my taste buds exploded with goodness!!! I highly recommend that particular combo and pretty much anything on the menu. We came back a couple of days later and got a variety of fresh lunch meat and cheeses. All of which we are still enjoying. They unfortunately were out of canolis, however we tried the NAPOLEON which, no surprise, was delicious!!! We got a loaf of the fresh bread to go with our deli meat that still tastes as good as it did 3 days ago when we bought it, as well as the texture has not hardened. Absolutely worth 5 stars. Service: excellent. Food quality: excellent. You feel like you're being cooked a quality home cooked Italian meal and the owners are there to personally assure that you are being taken care of and that it is up to the highest standards. Go try Defalco's!!","247750":"Worst experience ever from this great place! Body builder about 35 behind the counter, lost our order after 35 minutes, asked when our order would be ready. Got major attitude! asked for our money back, he wanted the receipt after just taking the order 45 minutes before and loosing our order. where did the nice guys go?","247839":"I just stopped by here today for lunch and am so happy I did.  I've driven by a number of times and just never went in.  \n\nI ordered the Combo sub on an Italian roll.  So good.  Everything I was hoping for.  They had a fresh deli and frozen section with all sorts of frozen pastas.  They also sell canolli baked fresh everyday.  I could definitely get in touch with my eye-talian roots here.\n\nI will most definitely be back on a regular basis for dinner, canolli, parties, Italian beer, you name it!  Mamma mia!","247870":"I am so disappointed in Defalco's today. I Ordered a Chicken Cutlet sandwich and it was definitely not the quality and portion I am used to getting here. I visit Defalco's about 5 times a year. Every single time prior to this one the food, service and overall rating for this restaurant was a 10. I love their food and the quality has always been phenomenal. However, this visit was absolutely terrible. Cold subs and very little meat in the sandwiches to say the least. The overall quality was a 2 on the scale I am used to experiencing at this location. I almost went to the counter and told them, but the employees were very cold and at times seemed to be lacking any leadership. Also, the soda machine in the main dining room was very dirty. I wont get in to details because i do love this place and respect that owners cannot be at the businesses at all times, but the oversight of cleanliness on this machine should be corrected ASAP. If you read this please do not let it stop you from trying it if you have never been. Like i said before, I have been going there for a very long time, back when they were at their previous location. It has always been awesome but this visit was a very bad experience. I hope that when I do decide to go back, they have corrected these problems and I can go back to Love Love Loving this place.","247893":"We used to love this place would recommend it to everyone. The last few times we've dealt with rude employees and incorrect orders. The last two times we ordered off of door dash and it was incorrect, called the store and the manager even admitted that he always has incorrect orders from them...shouldn't you stop dealing with them then? Or do you only care to get money without delivering on your end?? The only thing decent here are the cheesesteaks, anything else we've tried hasn't been palatable. After being a customer almost weekly here for a year I won't be returning. I've been in the industry for twelve years and Defalco's you should try having managers that actually manage instead of letting sixteen year olds run your business into the ground.","248651":"Nobody working here speaks Italian so I don't know how much of an Italian grocery it is. Chicken Parmesan was good. Meatball Pasta was over cooked. The sauce wasn't pasta sauce, but pizza sauce. It had too much rosemary and oregano.","249999":"Excellent spot. Great sandwiches at a good price, friendly service and lots of products to purchase. Coming back to try dessert!","250642":"Where to start?!? Unbelievable sandwiches and pastas. Great deli and grocery. Customer service is always quick, friendly and helpful. I always find a way to stop in when I'm in town.","251209":"Sssh, it's all oh so so so good don't tell anyone. Omg! Omg! Omg! The best Philly cheesesteaks (outside of Philly).... Cheese is melted and chopped INTO the meat... Had mine with mushrooms and a side of homeade italian wedding soup... Simply divine... Found a few torrone and back, a chunk of smoked mozzarella and scamolz to go! Felt I was back at the Philly Italian market... Now if they only had Italian rum cake (layered cake with rum creme) like you get at Termini's... That would definitely send you over the top!","251216":"Defalco's is my go-to spot for sandwiches in Scottsdale. I LOVE this place. Very good meats, and delicious sandy's all around. You can get some good beer here too, and every now and again I pick up a few groceries to take back home as well (pizza dough anyone?) \n\nThe biggest issue with Defalco's is consistency. On their very best day, this is EASILY a 5 star sandwich. However, they do have off days and happen to have them often. That's when you sink your teeth into a bready mess of a sandwich that leaves you feeling totally gypped. 3 stars for sure.\n\nMostly though, this place is quality and I would recommend it to anyone over the run of the mill \"fast food\" sandwich shops around town.","251638":"Been there 4 times now. I believe they have the best margarita and chicken pesto pizza in the valley. I want to try more things there..but I always get attracted to the chicken pesto. Definitely a must go in the valley. On late nights they also offer free bread loafs!!!","252731":"OMG AMAZING!!! The meatball sub and the cheese steak are so incredible, I have a tough time choosing between the two any time I go.  The pizza is awesome as well. I have yet to try a pasta dish (just can't get past those sandwiches) but they always look really great.  The store itself is so fun, lots of really great specialty Italian items.  The desserts and salads, etc. in the case for purchase always look fresh and delicious.\n\nTo top it off, the staff are polite, friendly, quick and super efficient!\n\nI take family here whenever they visit, and everyone keeps talking about it for weeks.  Definitely my favorite Italian spot in the valley.\n\nLittle tip: always get an extra side of marinara with a hot sandwich.  That stuff is liquid gold and I can never get enough.","252857":"Delicious, made from scratch food that always hits the spot. The philly cheese steak and beef au jus are amazing along with the homemade pasta. Just an overall great family owned establishment.","253314":"Let me start off with I am foodie and I normally don't right reviews unless it is extremely good or bad. This meal deserved a review it was so good.I had the fettuccine and Alfredo with the beaded chicken. This was the best I have ever had! This meal was not even in the same league as other Fettuccine and Alfredo dishes. Though the wait is a bit longer than wait I expected, the wait is well worth it!!!!","254046":"Every time I come here I get something different and I've never been dissapointed. Everything is so fresh, and put together so nicely. The staff is always so friendly and willing to answer any questions you have. love you Delfalcos. And you have found yourself a regular customer.","254064":"Awesome! when i worked down the street from here i literally ate here 2-3 times a week and always looked forward to it. cant go wrong with any dish. great prices and a lot of food. yet to find a better philly cheesesteak in AZ","254327":"Service is really slow. It took them 20-30 minutes just to take my order, and I was standing right by the register for to-go orders. They acknowledged me, but couldn't send anyone to help me. \n\nI ordered a whole cheese steak and a whole meatball sub expecting two giant sandwiches but seemed to get 2 separate half sandwiches each at around 4 inches long. You could tell they made them separately since the meat tapered at both ends of each piece. \n\nI was seriously disappointed at the size of these sandwiches for the price. I can't imagine spending $5 for one of these half sandwiches. They weren't even that stuffed full and the baguette wasn't very crisp, bordering on slightly stale. The take out box they gave me looked almost half empty with the sandwiches in there too.\n\nThe flavor of the meat  wasn't too bad though. The mushrooms were nice and the cheese sauce was really good too. It actually reminded me a lot of  the Uncle Sam's that used to be by my house. Better quality here, but I feel like I enjoyed the Uncle Sam's cheese steak more.\n\nThe meatball sub wasn't anything special to me either.\n\nNot sure I'd ever really come back.","254969":"Very tiny Italian deli, market and food store. The sandwiches and deli items are ok. The market carries a good selection of Italian groceries.","255581":"Everything is amazing and so fresh here. Love any of the subs, salads, pastas, and desserts! They also have an Italian grocery for any of your Italian cooking needs.","255592":"This was really excellent food at a great price. We are a family of four (2 adults and two teen boys). We wanted to try as many things as possible so got the lasagna, a calzone, a sausage and pepper sandwich and chicken Parma sandwich. They were all amazing and I am picky! The homemade sausage was out of this world and I'm not even a huge sausage fan normally. We also got a huge slice of strawberry cheesecake. The best I've ever had. That whole order was $49!  Come here!  You will have a wait but it's so worth it.","255650":"Rating this as anything less than 5 stars is damn near offensive. This place was outstanding. I had the chicken Parmesan which was awesome; my husband had a calzone with sausage, pepperoni, onion, and peppers. The sausage and pepperoni were made right there and were downright bitchin! We ended up shopping at their store too and picked up some salami and cheese for the trip back home. I wish that we could have something like this in Wisconsin, we would be there all the time!","255676":"Got hungry after going to the botanical garden and found this place based on all the reviews. The place is pretty cool - inside a grocery store with seating all around. Their portions are very generous for the price. I would recommend their pizzas but keep in mind the small could maybe feed three people.","256911":"Had a margarita pizza and it was a perfect Naples style pizza. The crust was slightly sweet and exactly the right amount of crispness on the bottom. The sauce was outstanding...Not bitter or over spiced. They kept true to the high quality ingredients they use. They have a good selection of Italian groceries at a lower price than what I've seen in similar places. Service is fast, friendly, and efficient.  Highly recommend!","257026":"I came here my second time on a Saturday righting between the lunch and dinner rush, hoping for a lull in terms of seating and business- no luck. We weren't fighting for a table but it was still hoppin! \n\nWhen you come in it can be easy to hold up the line if you don't know what you want, so be sure to be considerate of other people behind you. I ordered the Defalco's mac and cheese- a classic. It may or may not be laced with crack, because it may be the best Mac and cheese I've ever tried. The tables are surrounded by racks of Italian groceries so there is a kitschy intimacy to it. \n\nOverall- great food at a slightly above average price, homey environment, and good environment!","257283":"It's very good food but their menu deceived me. I ordered a margarita calzone and the toppings cost $8.  Kind of a let down.","257759":"This place has amazing food at a good price. They make the food quick so you don't have to wait long. The cheesesteak is the best mealts in your mouth.","258000":"Wow. The portobello mushroom sandwich was amazing 6\/5.   Also got the Caprese salad - high quality delicious mozzarella 5\/5. And finished with a cannoli which was yummy 4\/5.","258253":"We love Defalcos for casual dining and take out!  It's my teen daughter's favorite chicken Alfredo and they make a delicious chicken cheesesteak!   It's small and cozy with fantastic groceries to check out while you wait.  Unfortunately they also have wonderful desserts and baked goods so prepare to break your low carb diet from start to finish!  They also have lots of nice wines too!","258363":"Great spot!  Good food, affordable prices.  Had a great veggie sandwich that was full of fresh ingredients.  Had the veggie artichoke lasagne that was very tasty, but just a bit cold inside. Nice to be able to buy a bottle of wine from the shelf and enjoy it with our meal at a table.","258939":"Great local Italian food.  Grew up next to the Defalcos and they are class acts.  You might spend more than what you're looking to dish out, but trust me - it's worth every penny.","259762":"Everyone needs a good 'ol Italian deli in their neighborhood. I'm a vegetarian, and I still think this place is great. For starters, the wait staff is hilarious and create the laid back ambiance. The Caprese Salad is good, but unfortunately their \"amazing\" marinara is not vegetarian :(.. Still highly recommend","260159":"I've only been to Defalco's a few times, but each time I enjoy my experience. Although this Italian grocery store is located in a small space, Defalco's has a very simple line system that directs the customer to view all of their delicious treats and Italian goodies. If you're loving what you order, you can always pick up a few bags of pasta or sauce for the road! I'd like to go back here soon.","260446":"They have some wonderful things (like the ricotta-stuffed gnocchi and olive spread). The prices really are too high for a lot of the items, but that would be more acceptable if the whole experience were good. I can't give it a higher rating because the service is terrible (and I have been there a few times). It is not that the people are not nice, it is just so unorganized. And if you want more than one thing (like fresh sausage and then a sandwich), you will have to wait in TWO lines. If they could simply organize the flow of the service, I believe many more people would find the experience of going there better.","261574":"there need to be more places like this in the valley! \none thing we are missing is these small business family type owned delis and restaurants, we have enough corporate chain places already and they are all the same. \nthis place will blow them away. come in and order something to go. or just grab some amazing food and hang out on their patio have a glass of wine and enjoy. they have lots to chose from and the food tastes home made. it does take a bit sometimes but thats how you know its good. they make it when you order it. and the serving sizes and more then enough. i generally order a few things when i try someplace new and i got a full pizza and a pasta to try each..i had enough food for a week. and didnt break the bank. this reminds me of going to a deli in the mid west or east coast. I can not recommend it enough .","261834":"If you want  authentic type Italian food, Defalco's can't be beat.  The sandwiches are amazing particularly the Il Purista -  prosciutto, fresh home made mozzarella, basil, roasted peppers and balsamic drizzle - Its the best sandwich I have had since I moved to Arizona...I grew up in Brooklyn NY - eating frequently in Little Italy and this restaurant comes so close to the vibe and taste of NY - that I call it 'home'.  The owners care about their customers and although it is always crowded and you may have to wait on line - it is WORTH every second.  I highly recommend Defalco's!!","262245":"Super authentic Italian deli! Their cream soda was pretty good but the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich was definitely the highlight. The dining area is pretty small and nothing to write home about, but I love all the Italian grocery items you can pick up while waiting for your food. Defalco's is one of my new top spots for lunch!","262626":"Classy place. Cashier was drinking wine as he wrung us up. Not to mention the misters on the patio. Great sandwiches, especially the il purista.","263699":"Holy crap the food is large. I came here with three work buddies and ordered an Antipasto salad. The guy next to me, let's call him Brian ordered a calzone for 10 bucks. Well, my salad was gigantic and had all sorts of great meats and cheeses. I actually couldn't even finish the salad. Brian on the other hand had what I would say is a 12 ince cheese pizza rolled into a calzone that looked like a large football. It was enormous. The dough was very tasty and they totally didn't skimp on the cheese. Wow. It was great.","264811":"Love it! I've been going there for years!! I wish it was near me in Gilbert!","264990":"We went after seeing then on DDD.  The food was amazing!!!!  The people were great!!!","265276":"Wow, another gem in Scottsdale!  The food does take a while to arrive, but that is only because you are getting the freshest and best of what you could have ordered.  The atmosphere was great when I visited, a large group of people dining in the middle, laughing, and having fun, just what you'd expect from an Italian place, right?  The place smells devine, too.   So then there's the food...amazing!  Their breads are awesome, the sandwiches are nothing short of amazing.  You'll be back within a couple of days, if you can even hold out that long.","265413":"Very good food, decent size portions and made with care. Atmosphere is very authentic, moms-and-pops shop. Small tables, products separate dining areas.","265918":"Excellent Italian salumeria in Scottsdale. Pricey if you think you are entering a typical deli, but this is no typical deli. This is and Italian deli by Little Italy, NY standards. Get the Purista sandwich. Prosciutto, fresh mozz, roasted peppers and arugala. If I move here I know I'll have a little bit of home right down the block.","266090":"DeFalco's Italian Deli IS as good as it gets.  It is truly a snippet out of NYC! It's a great little authentic Italian deli with an incredibly great selection of foods behind the deli counters and a great selection of other Italian foods out and about the deli.  Not only do they have THE BEST cheese steak in AZ, all of their food rocks, at least all that I have and that has been almost everything on their menu.  I usually go with friends and we...I order for us, 2 whole sandwiches so we can do half and half.  The last round was the cheese steak and hot Italian sausage!  YUMMMMMMMMMMM!  By the way, their cannoli's are the BEST, not filled until ordered so the shell is nice and crunchy.  Gotta go, I'm hungry!!","266142":"Meatball, Mushroom Garlic Calzone is just so good.","266171":"I haven't bought anything from the grocery yet, but the food has always been reliable.  The sandwiches, in particular, are so good!  And the next time we have a party, I will definitely have to go back for the pasta salads, cheeses, and other deli items because they all looked amazing!","267303":"Excelente lugar , su personal es muy profesional y respetuoso ,su men\u00fa es bueno y muy buen elaborado,adem\u00e1s los due\u00f1os son espectaculares ... lo recomiendo se\u00f1ores .","267852":"I'm still loving Defalco's, maybe now more than before.  \n\nCheese steak is still great, I even chop it up and freeze it now and it reheats really well which is most bonus if you don't live close to Defalco's. Eggplant parm freezes well too.  The Il Purista is packed with tons of prosciutto and it is delicious. Their gnocchi is really good, mac and cheese is really good, and the garlic toast is tasty.  They give you a decent side salad with your pasta entrees too which is nice considering how many restaurants don't throw in any extras.  Saving the best advice for last, you MUST try their sausage. \n\nI wish they would open a Defalco's in North Scottsdale.....","267968":"I have been eating here for years. However I am done. Why? because they continually screw up my order or prepare it poorly!\n\nI have received half cooked pizzas, cold eggplant parm, ziti pasta when I ask for spaghetti. And sausage when I ask for meatball. Sometimes they forget the bread or salad.\n\nIt is pretty much the staff. They seem to have people on the kitchen line who do not care. One time asked for parm cheese packets for my pizza and they said they were out. But they asked the kitchen line for some for another customer and they got it.\n\nAlso, their food is not as good as you see on the reviews here. I am from NY and it does not even come close. Arizonians and snowbirds  have no idea what is good Italian food. This place has no clue how to make a meatball parm hero. Ordered once and never again. Pizza ok nothing to jump for joy. Portions are good. But the seating and beverage area is a little dirty most of the time.\n\nIt is shame because this was a go to place for take out dinner after a long day at work. But  tired of the rude girls working behind the counter and the constant bs with my orders for the last year. Yes I still went over the last year despite the bs.  BUT NO MORE LOYALTY HERE.","268093":"Why can't we have one of these in the bay area - I am doing an Italian grocery search and nothing comes close!!!\n\nI only wish It was walking distance from old Town - I mean, SURE, one could walk there, but you might burn off some of the delicious calories from this mecca of Italian goodness. \n\nEverything I have had there is good - spaghetti and meatballs, meatball sub, chicken parm\/sub, all wonderful. Plus, since the last time I visited, I have learned a thing or two about cooking - jeeze, I wish I had access to all the Italian goodies they sell on the grocery side! \n\nI will continue coming here as long as the Giants train in Scottsdale!","268148":"I had no idea what I was walking into for lunch one day on a business trip. I was a little nervous to order, but decided to go with a calzone. It came out larger than expected but the red sauce is so savory and delicious. I also got a side salad that was very fresh. As I ate looking at everyone else's food, it all looked delicious. I wish I had more days in town to try everything on their menu. I also went back another day just for their desserts, they have so many options!","268982":"I Love this place. It is by far the best Italian deli in AZ. I have been here numerous times and never once have I had a bad experience. \nThe guys who work there are always very nice and helpful.\n They have lots of food  and beverage options!\n\nI recommend the caprese salad and any of their sandwiches. SO delicious \n\nThe only down side is that when they are busy, the long line can also mean a long wait before you actually get your food.","270340":"Delicious little Italian spot on Scottsdale road. I usually order pasta here but would love to try some other menu items. Good thing I will be back soon!","270461":"Absolutely a must!\nLuckily we have friends who live close, so we can always order and bring home AMAZING pizza, outstanding sandwiches and cannolis to die for!\n\nWe are from the east coast, and this is the closest \"Philly food\" that we have found in the valley!","270541":"Seriously one of my favs in town but waited uber long for a hot sandwich that came out cold? Wth?","270811":"Always the best!!!  We go there as much as possible. It is completely reasonable and they have vegetarian options. Eggplant parmigiana is delicious. Don't get me started on the cannoli's. It's a must and they have a cute market.","271519":"Their marinara sause is out of this world! Stuffed pasta shells are wonderful, Phili cheese steak (with a side of marinara!), and deli sandwiches are all outstanding. It's a fun atmosphere with the italian grocery. Highly recommended.","272825":"Had a great Parmigiana sandwich and my friends also ate some chicken and other cold cut meat sandwiches.. great deli at great low prices!","272839":"Had a chicken parm sandwich on wheat bread for lunch. It was quite delicious! My meal tasted very fresh, and the bread has to be made fresh in-house, it was very good. I will absolutely be going back - a half sandwich is a very reasonable price.","273407":"My favorite deli in the Valley. The chicken pesto sandwich is amazing, but they're ALL amazing. And there's no other place in the Southwest that comes as close to real, NY-style cookies.","273620":"Love this place and have been going here for years. Never really try any of their grocery stuff but their sandwiches are all so good","273876":"Reminds me of the deli's in Italy where you eat among the groceries. Awesome desserts, Good Sandwiches and the Gnocci is outstanding. Nice to have a good meal with a glass of wine at relax on their patio.","274213":"Defalco's is a great spot!  They can cook you a great meal, or give you everything you need to cook your own.  I have bought a lot of pizza crust from them, amend it's a great deal.  They also have a lot of great salads, and amazing fresh mozzarella.","274521":"Everything here is good! I love the Maximus sandwich, and they are very accommodating and let me switch out a meat at no extra charge. I also love the arancini, which is yummy as either spinach and cheese or beef and cheese. If you haven't been here, you are missing something amazing in your life.","274599":"A friend recommended this place to me and told me that this was the best, authentic Italian food that he could find in the Valley.  With me having a gluten-allergy, I was a little hesitant to go but did agree to meet him there, and just decided beforehand that I would get a salad to keep my allergy from flaring up.  He got there a few minutes before me and asked the owner if they had any gluten-free dishes, he advised that they did not really have any on the menu, but that they did sell gluten-free pasta on their grocery shelves and that he would be willing to set up a fresh pot of boiling water for GF pasta and that I could choose from any of the dishes on the menu and substitute the GF pasta for the regular.  How could I turn down an offer like that??  My pasta was just as AMAZING as the customer service!","274649":"They definitely have the Italian Grocery Store thing down pat.  Service was pleasant though really really slow.  \n\nI decided to get the chicken cheesesteak....it was good, but wasn't the best I have ever had.  The pasta salad was good though it could have used more olive oil.  \n\nI'll be back to try something else for sure when I am in the area.  But it won't be something that I will run to South Scottsdale for anytime soon.","275091":"I am sitting here as I type this.  My wife, her parents and I were visiting from out of town and decided to drop by an \"Italian deli\" for lunch.  Firstly this place is closer to a deli you'd find on New York rather than one in Italy.  In line, I heard two people order fettuccine Alfredo for lunch... \n\nSo, here's our order:  one prosciutto sandwich (one if the few Italian items on the menu),  one Italian sausage sandwich, one portobello sandwich and one cheese panini.  While I was ordering,  the cashier ( the owner) kept giving me an odd look...like \"who do you think you ordering here?\"  I also got a beer which was on display.  When I asked for it,  he didn't know what it was so I had to show him the bottle.  Also, the request to have a double espresso and tea made later seemed to give him and an associate all kinds of inconvenience.  \n\nHere's what we got:\nThe prosciutto sandwich was good albeit a bit greasy.\nThe Italian sausage sandwich was OK.\nThe portobello sandwich NEVER arrived.  Instead we got another half of a sausage sandwich.  When I told this to the server, he said \"If you want portobello I'll make you one.\"  No apologies no cares.   When it finally came out, it was bad.\nThe cheese panini (which had bacon in it!) was nasty.\n\nWhen I went to ask for a knife,  the owner said that they should be out by the soda machine.  I informed him they were not.  He screamed for 'Ernesto to bring out the knives\" and told me \"the should be out soon, I THINK\".  Also got first apology of the day.\n\nThe espresso was atrocious.  It's beyond words how bad it is.   Really awful. Seriously.\n\nFinally,  to add injury to insult, we were overcharged 50c .  This was explained as a computer error.  We got the money back.\n\nWill NEVER return.","275673":"There is very little to say about this joint that has not already been said, but I can see why there are close to 700 reviews with almost a perfect rating.  It has been on my list for years, and yesterday I had the chance to have a late lunch there - I'm so glad I did!\n\nThere are a few Italian deli \/ markets around town, but by far this is the best one I've been to.  Of course they have a nice selection of Italian imports that will help make your meal the best it can be, but walking past the counters seeing the menu I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nI went with a sandwich, since it was my first time, which was easier knowing my girlfriend would order the shells and cheese with a meatball on the side.  I got the Il Purista - it just made sense.  Fresh basil, mozzarella, prosciutto, tomato and topped with a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it was perfection on a deli roll.  \n\nThe shells \/ cheese \/ meatball \/ fresh tomato sauce were everything you'd want in a bowl... the ricotta was hands down the creamiest and freshest I've had the pleasure of eating.  \n\nTopped it off with a beer and a healthy serving of Italian nostalgia for a lunch that everyone in Phoenix should have at least once.  I did notice that they cater for large groups \/ events and this will be on a short list in case I ever need anything along those lines.  GO HERE and enjoy!","276353":"I'm being redundant adding to the 5 star reviews but it was deserving. I wish there was a place like this near me.\n\nLoved the ambiance....good outdoor seating... Enough tables inside among the groceries.\nGreat place to relax.\n\nMeatball sandwich.....excellent.\nChocolate eclair. ...superb\nGreat drip coffee \nCounter order....then food brought to table.\nService very attentive.\n \nDefinitely a place to check out.","276398":"First time at Defalco's and gotta say we were disappointed. It took us 30 minutes to get our food (1 pizza and 2 pastas), and when it came out all 3 entrees were lukewarm, like they had been sitting there for a while. The gnocchi was over-cooked and mushy and the pizza was soggy. The atmosphere is cute and warm, and you get a lot of food for the money. But it doesn't make up for the cold food and slow service. Not very impressed with the place and likely won't be back.","277251":"Back for a simple Turkey and Provolone hero and discovered the homemade choc. chip cookies laced with macadamia nuts, coconut and lots of big chips. Both of these items were quite good and the key for the sandwich was the sesame seed roll and of course the price was only 7 bucks for a giant 12 inch fresh sandwich. On this Sunday at 2pm it wasn't crowded, but I did call and order ahead which is still the best method for take-out.\n\nStuffed Shells - 8\/15 - The shells are stuffed with a dense ricotta which is both creamy and filling. Five good size shells, but they failed to melt any mozzarella over the top, leaving me feeling a bit empty inside. Only 9 bucks for the meal, but cheese was a big omission in my mind.","277747":"DeFalco's is one of my absolute favorite places! You order at the back counter and then take a seat among the shelves of Italian goodies. They have so many imported Italian products that I feel like I'm back in Italy when I'm there. The line can get long during lunchtime, but it moves pretty fast and you get to look at all the different wines, meats, cheeses, and desserts while you wait. The staff is friendly and helpful. The portions are huge and very reasonably priced. I'm on a mission to try everything on their menu. My favorites so far are the chicken parm sub (perfect on their Italian sub roll), the cheesesteak (both beef and chicken are fantastic), the Italian combo sandwich, and the il purista (so good on a baguette). The pizza and cannoli are also fantastic. I stop here whenever I'm in the area, no matter what time of day.","278025":"Seriously this place has the best mac and cheese. The fact that this place is also an Italian grocery store with a variety of cheese and wines is really neat. The food is good, and it's a family environment. I came here with family visiting from out of town and we all loved our entrees.","278258":"Being from the East Coast, I have been searching for an Italian Grocery\/Eatery that can reliably and consistently dish up Italian food like I am accustomed to back East.  I think I may have found my new Italian home!\n\nI found this location on Yelp (thanks Yelp) and visited based on the extremely strong recommendation from Christy S.....you know a restaurant is good when a fellow Yelp'er is willing to pay for your lunch if you dont enjoy it!  So today I stopped and ordered the meatball sandwich on an Italian hard roll....just like I would back home.  WOW!  Absolutely amazing!\n\nWhile waiting for my lunch, I wandered about the grocery to see what I would come back to purchase later.  Defalco's will certainly receive some of my money in the near future.  They have a great selection of meats, wines, pasta's and deserts!  One of my favorite deserts that my mom used to make is Pitzels....and yes - they have them!  \n\nI look forward to going back to Defalco's soon....and sipping on some wine next time while I wait for my meal.  Definite 5 stars in my book!","278628":"First time guest! Went with an Italian sub and it was pretty delicious. Bread was good, toppings were excellent, meat was delicious. My only issue was that I waited almost 20 minutes for it. The staff was side tracked with side work.","278763":"I had the most amazing gnocchi here! It was like little pillows of deliciousness. The decor isn't anything special, but the food more than makes up for it.","280676":"This place is seriously overrated.  Food is good, but not great.  I think something that bothers me the most is the attitude we got from the staff...as if we were an inconvenience. Yeah buddy, I hate when customers come into my restaurant and give me money too....  Anyways, you can get much better Italian elsewhere!","282545":"This is my go to!!! Being from New York, it's hard to find a legit Chicken Parm hero, and that centurion calzone is amazing!!!!!","282738":"This place is amazing! Food is amazing and price is reasonable. \nYou can buy fresh pizza dough to make your own pizza at home! It's a nice family feel with lots of variety.","282742":"Great food, best cheese steak I've ever had. Sometimes can be too much bread, to little filling. This is a very popular lunch spot for local businesses, so be prepared for a crowd if you go around lunch. I recommend calling in orders ahead of time if in a hurry.","284706":"Good service but the food wasn't good, which was saddening because I was looking forward to the Philly cheesesteak and the classic pizza. Neither were good.  The Philly was made with white American cheese and I wasn't aware that the cheese came in it so it was super salty and weird tasting simply because processed cheese was in it. Pizza was bland.","284931":"Been going here for years and it's the best Italian spot I know of in Arizona. Fresh homemade pastas to cook at home, pizza, sandwiches, deli, anti pasta, and all sorts of side salads. I've tried almost everything and it's all delicious. Everything is super fresh, and they'll make anything you want. It's always a tasty Italian experience with a great local business feel. Everybody I've brought here has a great experience as well.\n\nThe only thing that is tough is it gets super busy at the popular times, so it's tough to get a seat if you want to eat there. Other than that I have no complaints.","284967":"My husband and I are 20+ year happy patrons of DeFalco's.  In the last year, we've visited a few times, and the quality is simply not there anymore.  This last time, it was inedible (chicken parm).  One of our friends (also a long time patron) mentioned that he recently visited and had the same reaction to his meal.  The three of us are sadly done.","285314":"I have been to this place countless times, and I love it! If I am ordering food I typically call ahead. Some of my favorites are the eggplant parm and antipasto salad, but really you can't go wrong. I love this place as an Italian grocery. The quality of the pasta, sauces, oil, etc is fantastic. I meat and cheese available at the deli counter is exquisite. The staff is always friendly and often hilarious!","285615":"Gone downhill. Used to be great, everything fresh and homemade. Now it seems to be processed and different recipes. Sad to see it change.","285657":"I just moved here from LA. I love Italian deli and I didn't think I'd be able to find a turkey sandwich as good as what I've had back at my old home. This deli is above and beyond! It is a currently me and my boyfriends go to place for some of the best pizza ever. We are talking authentic pizza! Great staff great place I would recommend to everyone","285937":"I've been to Defalco's a handful of times before with average customer service, and above average southwestern Italian food. However, tonight, I ordered a soup, they were out of. The cashier refused to make more of the soup of the day. After waiting 10-15 minutes to hear the news, he offered a dinner salad. The salad was not fresh and the lettuce was unsatisfactory, after waiting an additional 10 minutes. I went up to the counter and spoke to the owner. He offered to give me another salad, which at that point I didn't want to wait any longer. He finally gave me cash back, after giving me some of the worst customer service experience I've received at any restaurant in Arizona.\n\nThe worst part is that he would NOT listen to me when I told him the lettuce tasted stale and out of date. He outright denied my claim. I have not received such an attitude toward a customer before. He had no reason to give me a snarky, self-righteous attitude. He acted completely full of himself and his restaurant, saying that it was fresh and I was wrong. It's not that hard to please the customer. I will not return and can't recommend this restaurant based on their refusal to put the customer first. I'm pretty sure I know how a fresh salad should taste and this was not up to par. Not a big deal, don't attack the customer. That's unacceptable. There are a number of Italian restaurants I frequent in Tempe and Scottsdale and will go to them in the future. Defalco's inability to give a welcoming and positive experience is not well received and will not be tolerated.","286321":"WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! Too bad you can't give 10 stars! This is a great place to get AUTHENTIC Italian food at a VERY REASONABLE price. Everything from salads and sandwiches to full meals. Real Italian creme sodas, deli, desserts, GROCERY STORE, you name it, they have it. We were visiting our daughter in Scottsdale. SO GLAD that she knew about DeFalco's. WOW, WOW, WOW!!! I had the eggplant Parmesan (it comes in two sizes, I should have gotten the small!) and my husband had their Italian sausage and peppers sandwich. My daughter had alfredo and her boyfriend had the meatball sub... all sandwiches come with your choice of homemade breads. The deli counter looked amazing and the smells... ahhhhhhhhhhhh! The first time we stopped, my husband and I shared the turtle cheesecake. The next time we were in the area we stopped specifically for their lemon cake... WOW! If you are in the old downtown Scottsdale area and you love Italian, YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP at DeFalco's!!!","286746":"Being from New York, this place is truly the closest place I have found out west to NY cuisine.  One of the best sandwiches I have ever had!","286772":"So good! They were super accommodating to our large group and even let us use forks and plates for a cake I brought in. Food was great as always. We were celebrating a birthday and telling our family about our engagement and couldn't have asked for a better experience!","286810":"Fresh, fantastic deli and market.  Their sandwiches are to die for.  I really like their fettuccine alfredo as well.  They are a little slow and the line is always really long so be patient when you go there.","287407":"The most outstanding Italian deli experience I could  imagine. Guy Fierris show on this spot was right on! Worth the effort","288131":"Great little deli!  The centurion stromboli was worth the trip, I'll be back to explore the menu and wine selection further the next time I'm in Phoenix.","288407":"We had lunch on a Saturday, the place was packed (always a good sign) and we had to sit outdoors...not a big deal because the water-misting system actually cooled us off. I had the classic Italian sandwich and it was...GREAT! A nice shot of espresso to go with, and one of my buddies got the Italian meatball sandwich (with cheese) he says it's awesome, and I always believe what he says, so it's awesome. A little side note, the deli and restaurant sit amidst an Italian grocery store and they actually had a couple items I had been searching all over for: hot giardinara mix and sport peppers. Yes, sport peppers are nowhere to be found in Phoenix...except at DeFalco's! In case you are wondering, sport peppers are the ones used in Chicago-style hot dogs, so you can't have an authentic Chicago-style hot dog without sport peppers, and you can't have sport peppers in Phoenix without visiting Defalco's. Actually, you should bring a few hundred dollars to blow in the grocery store because every item is unique, and you're going to want at least one of everything. You have been told. In conclusion, our afternoon at DeFalco's was pleasurable and  out of the ordinary. I am looking forward to our next visit. Oh yeah, CANOLIS!","289137":"OMG this place was sooooooo good! We will definitely came back again. \n\nI had the baked ziti (half a plate). My husband had a calzone. And we got the kids a small pizza which was huge (it was bigger then a Barros medium pizza)","290577":"Fantastic Italian subs! Just like back in Jersey...So much meat, it's like the opposite of all the other sub chains. \n\nWhy do they have to be so far from home?","290811":"Have eaten here many times and times it! Anything you get will be good. If you're short on time order over the phone and pickup, otherwise you will be waiting a while, needless to say the wait is worth it. My favorite is the Ruben, which is not in the menu, but they will make it.","291225":"Always the best with no regrets.  Their Il Purista sandwich is about as good as it gets.  This time I got warm bread with cool ingredients speaking to the freshness of everything they do.  The deserts were all perfect and I think our group downed six bottles of wine while there.  Great prices on wine in case you have not looked.  We had a 2010 Zepaltas La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast that knocked my socks off.  Damn good wine!!!!\n\nThe Linguine with white clam is killer as are anything with their meatballs.  In the deli case is a home made sausage rolled like a spiral that has parsley and cheese that has to be the best stuff on earth.  If you have not tried it just do it with some good bread they sell there and you will be in love!\n\nI've known Tony for a long time now and must say he and his wife are some of the sweetest people.  It is great to see a family owned and operated restaurant do so well and keep\/improve their quality over time.  It's places like this that keep food alive and well in America and keep the massive restaurant corporations away from ever receiving a dime of my money.  \n\nI've been in the back kitchen and the place is spotless.  Everything they do they do well and they are a solid Yelp 5-star joint.  I just wish he would open a Gilbert store in DT Gilbert.  Would be a perfect place for that location!","291244":"My wife and I are each half Italian so I like to say we make a whole Italian!  I've been looking for a place like this since I moved to Arizona more than 30 years ago - an authentic Italian grocery store that also serves prepared dishes.  For us, this was everything familiar - familiar brands, familiar ingredients, familiar treats and sweets.  \n\nWe ordered in and did a little grocery shopping as well.  Their prepared food is outstanding and the real deal.  Their groceries and other items are a tad on the pricey side but that is expected when you want genuine Italian brands and you need them quickly.\n\nAlthough we live a couple of hours north of Defalco's, we do visit the Valley frequently and this delightful establishment will become a regular stop for us when we find ourselves nearby.","291347":"Great Italian grocer and restaurant! Philly cheesesteaks, calzones and pizzas are all excellent. Check out the freezer section for Gelato and fresh pasta. The fridge near the to go pick up counter also has raw pizza dough if you are wanting to stretch it and make your own at home (fun date night). Not a 5 because the pizza needs to be eaten fresh, otherwise it gets soggy and a bit rubbery.","291497":"CHEESE STEAK- this is the pinnacle of greatness in a meat sandwich.  Everyone who has tried this sandwich along with me for the 1st time has shook their head up and down with no words. Just more chewing.  Along with their other sandwiches served with great bread choices and Italian dinners this place is a winner on each visit.  Tip- order ahead during lunch hours because it takes 15-20 minutes due to being so busy.  Other times it is 5-10 minutes tops.","291603":"Defalcos is a small gem of a deli. Ill keep this short and sweet. Fresh pasta, meats, cheeses and more. Just.show up at lunch and realize the 30 min wait is because its fantastic food. \n\nIf you are a cheesesteak fan, this is about as good as it gets.","291631":"I went here on a friends recomendation and had take out. \n\nI ordered a full order of chicken parmesean, for my husband, which comes with a nice salad and bread. Generous portions. \n\n We were disappointed to say the least. The food is marginal at best. The chicken parmesean was overcooked, dry, and salty. Their \"homemade sauce\" is just barely okay at best. \n\nI ordered gnocchi with pesto for myself.\n\nThe pesto was so bland with very little flavor, definitely the worst pesto I've ever had. \n\nThey do have a deli and and a small store I may consider getting some deli sometime. I will not be ordering anything from the menu again.\n\n I do not recommend the restaurant food.","291731":"1\/07\/10\nMy first visit here was maybe 3 or 4 years ago w\/ a friend, and we'd intended to try dinner and perhaps split a pastry.  However, after looking over the dessert display case, we decided to have a pastry tasting party, instead!  My fave pastries that day (and we had sampled 6 or more, maybe 8, different varieties!) were the chocolate-chip studded cannoli and napoleon.  His was, of course, his fave Italian pastry, the sfogliatelle.  I remember it having a lemon cream filling and not enough of it.  But he was happy with it, and that's all that mattered.  \n\nFast-forward to last month, I decided to try their stuffed shells, $9, which came w\/ 5 shells, a side salad, and garlic bread.  Salad was your basic salad w\/ olives and a pepperoncini, but I liked the generous portion and how fresh and crisp it felt and tasted.  The foil-wrapped garlic bread was nothing to rave about (I didn't even bother to take a picture of it after I had a bite!).  The jumbo shells were very good- loved the ricotta filling and the melty cheese on top!  However, had I known that the dish came w\/ marinara sauce, I'd have requested it be omitted.  Not that it didn't taste great- it did, if not a bit too salty, but I do better w\/ cream-based rather than tomato-based sauces.\n\nCan't wait to try more from the menu!\n\n(Had great pics to add here, but for some reason the \"add photo\" link was missing!)","291770":"Found this place on yelp and took my wife mom and 4 kids and wow it was amazing. Definitely worth it. Best lasagna ever","292436":"Defalco's Let me count the ways thou love ye.\n1. The freshest Ingredients\n2. Everything is literally  amazing (especially the chicken salad sandwich)\n3. Cheesecake and all deserts are off the Chizain\n4. Store even smells great\n5. Italian done right \n\nSeriously been coming here for 12+ years. EVERYTHING is good. The wait is long because they make it fresh, so if you lack patience phone your order in. Go here NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously stop reading this and go to Freaking DEFALCO'S JABRONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh really your going to sass me now? That's it no Chicken Salad for YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","292469":"DeFalcos is the best! The Beef Cheesesteak sandwich is the best thing on the menu. While their Cannolli & lemon bars are also very authentic and tasty.","293003":"Just took the kids here for lunch and had to write a review. My kids loved this place!  We took the advice on this site and ordered ahead.  Our food was ready when we got there and was the perfect temperature-not to mention fabulous!  I have one very picky child and DeFalco's was happy to cater to all of our specifc requests for leaving things out and adding things in.  I did ask the staff about the service comments listed here and they said a lot of people do not realize that everything is made fresh to order and that takes a little time.  I guess the same things that make it good make it a little slower (or it could be because the are picking all the onions out of my little ones dish for us)-but it is definitely worth the wait!  We will be back.","293069":"Best Cheesesteak in town!!\n\nI am a huge fan of Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches, even though I am from the west, and I talked to one of my other foodie friends on where the best one in town is. They said DeFalcos for sure. Since I was in the area I decided to give it a try. Now, I tend to lean more towards a Cheez Whiz Philly over a provolone Philly, but I may have to rethink that decision after trying this one. Everything about this sandwich was great, from the first bite to the last, every bite was the perfect blend of meat, cheese, bread, and peppers. I am glad I ordered a whole because I would have been very sad if I just got a half.\n\nAs for the establishment, I have heard there can be very long waits, but I must have been lucky. I was able to walk right in and order. They had a very nice beer selection as well. As well, if you need anything authentic to make a home cooked italian meal, this is definitely the place where you can find it.\n\nI will be back very soon!!","293150":"I love their turkey and provolone cold sub! Delicious with pickles added.","293191":"For those looking for a quality sub and can't find it at a chain restaurant this is the spot. Subs are priced a little high compared to a chain but you get what you pay for.","293417":"Friendly Services. Good Food. Fair Prices. Eager to go back there to try something new~","294075":"WOW!!! My hubby and I where looking for a new take-out place close to our house and we stumbled on this gem. Defarlco's has been a Scottsdale staple for quite some time, but I do not remember ever stopping by. On this day, I am glad I did. We ordered the Beef Cheese Steak, with mushrooms and onions. I also got a side of their au jus sauce on the side for dipping. By the type I got home, this sandwich was still piping hot and smelled delicious. Everything tasted so fresh and my hubby inhaled his sub. We have added Defalco's to our take-our roster. \nThank you so much for bringing quality Italian food to Scottsdale!","294099":"Great place, they have a ton of authentic Italian ingredients. I hold my delis to a high standard though and it's not basic enough to compare to delis from New York. My friends presents who are from Italy we're impressed but not amazed. Great for AZ standards.","294763":"We had Alfredo Gnocchi, cheese steak sandwich and linguini pasta with clams today. All were fantastic and the portions and prices were very satisfying. They also have amazing ice tea selections. Check this place out!","294767":"This is the best Italian food I have ever had! My recommendations are the Alfredo gnocchi, the calzone (I like sausage, mushrooms, and red onions), and the Cheesesteak is phenomenal. I know what you're thinking, \"Why would I go to an Italian restaurant for a Cheesesteak?\" But let me tell you, you will not be disappointed, it is probably the greatest thing ever. They make their own sausage in store too which is delicious! Don't be boring and just order the spaghetti and meatballs, they're good but they pale in comparison to the other options on the menu! It's located in a super cute Italian market, if you're bringing a large party you can push tables together, but I'd recommend getting there a bit early to make sure you can grab the tables!","295809":"CHECK OUT YOUR TAKE OUT ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE STORE!!!!!!!!\n\nWe recently visited the store twice.  Food and service were great for the first time.  \n\nHowever, in our second visit, they forgot to give us the napoleon dessert we ordered, which is $4.99 a piece before tax.  We found out that after 10 miles of driving.  Called the store to ask for credit.  Nothing has happened, kind of expected, even though whoever answered the phone said will credit it back to us.  \n\nSo while you think about how good their food is ....  Make sure you check out your take out order to prevent any surprises that you might experience later ........\n\nWe weighted the two visits and give them 2 stars.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAnthony, the owner, was nice enough to get in contact with us and let us know of their policy.  DeFalco's has a policy where if something you ordered wasn't in your take out order they will automatically credit you back that purchase and give you that same item for free next time you visit; a credit one give one policy.  Good food and good service.","296269":"Defalco's will always have a special place in my heart. This one of a kind Italian deli nestled on the border or Scottsdale and Tempe has served me at least 15 lbs of prosciutto over the last few years. I go here for one reason only, the Il Purista sandwich. It's basically 1 while inch of prosciutto and fairy dust on a French baguette. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving Defalco's four stars is because the service is pretty rough. When I'm having an amazing day and feel on top of the world, I come to defalco's because I know they can even me out with their stern personalities, long wait times for takeout, and overall lack of smiling\/positivity. Though I enter their doors and soon lose self esteem, I continue to come back time and time again to be reunited with their prosciutto and phenomenal ingredients. \n\nPro tip - leave your personality at the door but bring your tastebuds and second stomach.","297102":"My boyfriend and I's go-to-spot for delicious Italian dishes. My current favorite is meat ravioli or gnocchi with their vodka sauce (incredible!). Their Philly cheese steaks are also delicious!","297529":"Always delicious and one of our favorite spots. Love the Bianca. Their salads are also great including the pesto and chicken with spinach. And they have a amazing ranch for their garden salads!","299280":"Best meatball sub and great customer service. The antipasto salad was amazing too!   They also have a variety of different olives and wines.","299282":"Had Ceasars Salad and Margherita Pizza. Both outstanding. Crust on pizza was the best ever. Order at counter and it's delivered to your table. Definitely going back.","299762":"Was not impressed with eating here after a Family friend recommended it. I got a lasagna and a Greek salad. Interesting part about the salad: there wasn't any lettuce! I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it tasted just ok. \n\nLasagna was cool in the middle and my friend's dish was ice cold when she cut it in half. When she said something he offers to reheat it (in a microwave I'm guessing), not a new one that was at the correct temperature. \n\nIf you were grocery shopping here this place may get the job done, but I wouldn't make a special trip here.","299903":"Went there for my first time for lunch today I ordered the Italian Sausage With Peppers & Onions. First off the  online menu was cheaper that in store price I had said something to the person who took my order and didn't ask what online price was to even honer it nor seemed to concern about my comment, two I ordered it to go I only work a mile and half from there and my food was luke warm. It was ok not the best I've had.","300047":"I'm from the northeast and this place reminds me of home. It's like walking into an  Italian deli back east (or about as close as you can get to it out in the desert).\n\nChick Parm...deli meats...fresh pizza dough...I love this place. They also sell a lot of Italian groceries you won't find in the local supermarkets. Pretty cool...","300116":"Nice environment, the calzone has waaay too much cheese it's hard not to choke on it , other than that it's good experience.","300254":"Authentic Italian, pizzas calzones and sandwiches are excellent but spirits a bit pricey.  Overall a great experience.","300961":"Defalco's is one of my favorite lunch spots. I read the reviews that talk about the lines, I have to tell you I never saw them as that bad. Sure, you have to wait a few minutes, but it generally works out ok. One item not mentioned thus far, an item not on the menu but something they'll make any time is the Portabello mushroom sandwich. The grocery items seem expensive, but the sandwiches are completely reasonable\n\n\nI'm not sure how they are doing right now with the tomato scare, but I know I'll be visiting Defalco's again soon.","301730":"Had the pastrami on Italian bread. Quite liked it. Baklava was delicious. Antipasto = top notch. Canelone, though, was my favorite.","302467":"Defalcos has already become a regular stop for my boyfriend and I and I don't see that changing any time soon. Upon recently moving to AZ, I didn't have much hope to be able to find quality, authentic Italian food. Defalcos totally proved me wrong and beyond.\n\nThe place was\/is in the process of construction so it was a little confusing when we first visited, nonetheless, a very nice place. It's a little restaurant with a little market attached which adds a very casual vibe - which I appreciate.\n\nThe food knocked my socks off. For the price and quality ingredients you can taste in just one bite, this place is totally worth a try. If you're ever in the Scottsdale area, make an excuse to stop by. You won't be disappointed.","302671":"The food is consistently good. Good selection of wines and pasta in their little market. Be prepare to wait about 20 minutes for your order, especially when its busy.","303297":"Have been here twice and both times was great service and delicious. Upon my third visit I walked in and stood at the normal counter that I order a drink at. The man took 10 minutes to help me. Then when he asked me what I wanted and I replied he decided to give me a dirty look, shake his head and point to the other counter and say \"seriously man, I'm slammed. Order down there.\" I replied \"this is the counter I always order at.\" He chose to ignore me. After that I didn't even want to order, I simply walked out. I wish he was wearing a name tag so I could tell his manager what a disrespectful employee he was. For this, I will no longer be eating\/drinking here.","304043":"Ahhh, a breath of fresh air! Being from MA, a highly populated Italian state, I grew up going to Italian groceries like this, and it made me a bit home sick.  A tiny little establishment inundated with products and heck they were even able to squeeze a couple of table in there for dining. The shelves are lined with numerous imported products from Italy, and not just pasta was a relief to see. Canned tomatoes, pasta, gnocchi, candy, cookies, etc.  Although I have not tried too many items on their menu, I have not had a single complaint about anything I have tasted.  The only thing that is missing is the smell.  I used to go to a place in Franklin, MA called \"Ferraras\".  Their original place was there for generations, and for generations it has had meats hanging, fresh meat being butchered, and the women in the back cooking up a storm.  You just walked in and were immediately hit with the aroma of 100 years of delicious treats.  Although Defalco's does not have that yet, I'm sure over time it will get to that level.","305443":"Great place. The food is fantastic and you can find some good authentic Italian groceries.","306210":"I see some bad bad reviews & to those people I say please don't go back you are crowding my favorite place to eat in the valley!! Some people just expect this 5 star service, but it's a deli not a restaurant! They are very busy!! If you want the best sometimes you have to wait!\nEverything is good you can't go wrong! And always very consistent for the last 20+ years I've been going there.\nHaters stay away!","306678":"Ordered a Caprese Salad, Baked Ziti and a large cheese pizza. Delicious with Bodega Pierce Emotiva an Arizona Wine from Willcox.","309230":"Always the best italian with no B.S. the lasagna is my favorite. The sandwiches are great. Stuffed shells bomb. Tiramisu awesome. Cheesecake also great.","309269":"hands down the best deli\/grocery in Phx and one of the best in the country.  hot\/cold sandwiches, traditional italian dinners, and a wine\/beer list that will blow your mind.","309620":"We came for the first time because of all the nice reviews and left dis -appointed, -gusted, -approved, -dained.\n\nThe people were terrible to us, the place was a mess, we did not get any help or service being it was our first time.\n\nThen when we went to sit down the floor was wet all over and we ended up having to jump around to sit outside.  Apparently the bathroom overflowed per one of the employees.  It probably should have been closed.\n\nThe food was nothing special and actually below average.   I ordered one of their sandwiches and it was missing items that were supposed to be on it.  Not to mention they forgot to even make it; I had to go up and ask for them to make it.  The pizza ordered was soggy, greasy and devoid of flavor.   No napkins or silverware was provided.  Nobody bother to check on customers.  The tables were disgusting, I cleaned them myself with alcohol wipes.\n\nIn our time there, we noted two other customers who also had bad experiences.  Maybe a bad day, but still unacceptable.  Just not worth the money or time for that kind of experience.\n\nNever again!","309683":"I just ate a pepperoni & black olive pizza, you can taste the quality of the ingredients. I am defiantly getting another!","309891":"Amazing selection of deli meats!  The prosciutto sandwich is my fave, I haven't tried anything else but I just love prosciutto.  I've recently started buying the grocery store products to incorporate into my Italian cooking and my recipes have never tasted better.  I feel like a master chef now.  I will never again use Prego, I'm embarrassed to even admit that I ever used it!","310054":"Great atmosphere in here. Good food at reasonable prices. If you have time I recommend eating in. Nice experience. After you order, just choose your cozy table in any area of the building, lots of private nooks to choose if you want privacy. When your order is ready they will come around and find you delivering it right to your table. We like it here!","310353":"Stopped in for an Italian beef and walked out with the best Italian beef sandwich hands-down!  From the melt-in-your-mouth, tender and lean beef to the oven-fresh bread, every bite was amazing!  The whole sandwich was so huge, I took the other half home for later.  I've had a lot of Italian beefs around town, but they don't come close to DeFalco's.  Can't wait to return to try one of their other sandwiches or pasta. Great value, good people and quality food!","310628":"I get the Maximus sandwich on sourdough each time I come and it never disappoints. They have many options to choose from and I plan on trying new items on future visits.","310752":"Places like this are such a refreshing change of pace here in Phoenix.  Even if the food weren't good, I'd recommend people to come here just for the atmosphere. \n\nI came here on a recommendation from a customer of mine, and I was not at all disappointed.  The place is usually busy, so I'd suggest ordering over the phone and skipping the 10-15 minute wait, if you're in a hurry.\n\nThe employees were friendly and made good suggestions for a 1st-timer like myself.  I'm with the other reviewers: keep this in the DeFalco family!  You've got a great thing going, keep it up.","310797":"The white pizza and the Gnocci are amazing! Great customer service. Sit outside if weather permits.","311395":"Quite possibly the best sandwich I've had in Scottsdale. The Capicola is incredible and their deli selection is second to none. I've even taken trips there to pick up fixings to make a pizza. They sell everything, even a large sack of fresh-made dough. I can't leave with just dough though, it's usually accompanied by kalamata olives, margherita pepperoni and a can of sauce. It's a blast to make their pizza at home but it's just as fun to browse the shelves while picking up the ingredients.","312910":"I am a New Yorker who loves deli, and this place is perfection! They have all your favorite Italian dishes, sandwiches, pizza etc. best deli in the valley hands down.","312948":"Just awesome all around. \n\nMeatball sub was perfect as was my Dad's Italian sandwich. \n\nLarge portions and prompt service. \n\nWish they had more seating...\n\nA must try if you're in the area.","313021":"Had the steak and cheese sandwich for lunch.  Took about 25 minutes to come out and the deli wasn't very busy.  Flavors were great.  Would recommend if you have time for a longer lunch or dinner.  Great value for the money.","313023":"What can I say?  Saw Defalco's on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dive's and decided to give it a try, after passing the place probably 5000 times over the years.  Everything was pleasant and certainly decent enough, until today, when I called with a complaint.  Ordered the Napoleon to go yesterday and got it home, and it was basically inedible.  Had to throw out the $5 dessert, which, btw, is overpriced considering you can get a whole pasta meal with salad for $8.50.  But that's another story.  The napoleon was dry, hard, tough and stale.  I was thoroughly disappointed, disappointed enough to where I felt they deserved a call.  Spoke to the manager, maybe owner, just 10 minutes ago.  He apologized and really had nothing else to say.  Wouldn't the smart thing to do, be to invite me back in, offer me a replacement, something??  Nope.  Nothing.  He even continued to say how someone else complained a few days ago about the same thing, so he then went to taste it, and thought it was fine.  UH??  Two people complained and he thinks it's fine.  Shouldn't the customer's opinion matter more than his own?  Am I missing something here?  Why even say someone else complained?  There's obviously something wrong with it if 2 people complained within days of each other.  Needless to say, the way it was handled was a complete turn off.  Not sure I would bother going back, as I think customer service goes a long way, and they were obviously lacking in that department.","313671":"You wouldn't expect a grocery store to have a long line for the restaurant, but I understand why now--Excellent food.  My Stromboli was soooo-good and so big. Took most of it home and had several meals on it. Good food.","314138":"Went to Defalco's for lunch recently and was instantly consumed by the smell of fresh bread, garlic and sauces. Like walking into an Italian Grandmother's kitchen. Intoxicating. \n\nThe deli case stocked full of salami, pastrami and every other -ami you can imagine! There were olives, cheeses and already prepared dishes that you can eat there or take home. I ordered the cheese lasagna. You pay for it, take a number and wait. While waiting, let your eyes and senses shop the grocery area with all sorts of imported pastas, sauces  and other products. \n\nYou can't be in a rush with this place. About 10-12 minutes later, voila! My lasagna arrived to the table with a warm, crusty side of garlic bread. So damn good! I simply cannot wait to stop in again. \n\nBon Appetite~","314434":"Stuffed peppers = delicious!  Of course the sandwiches are good too (just read the other reviews).  Only negative is that a weekday lunch might take a while to order and then get your food.","314830":"Location: small parking lot and it was hard to find. The store isn't very well organized. It is a Italian grocery store that also service food, sells meat products as well as selling coffees\/sodas\/dessert. They have dining table in between the aisles - it makes it tough to shop for things by constantly reaching or peaking over tables when customers were eating their meals. I honestly don't understand why they don't separate the shopping from dining area. It was very confusing and inconvenient for shoppers. \n\nService: it was decent, but staffs were doing too much and too many things. Within 2 minutes of ordering my vanilla Italian soda, he turned around and helped someone else. Once he turned back around, he completely forgot what I originally ordered. Nevertheless, staffs were friendly \n\nFood: I ordered a Italian soda and it was almost all sodas. I couldn't even finish it. However, a group of us ordered dessert and it was delicious. Especially the Tiramisu. I purchased their ice cream here. Though it was a bit pricey, it was totally worth Every penny. \n\nRating: I want to come back and try their sandwiches and lingerie with clam sauce I've heard so much about.","314914":"Defalco's Defalco's Defalco's... How I love you.\n\nI love your vast selection of wines. Your OUTSTANDING dessert options (and I don't even typically EAT desserts... but that cheesecake...!!). Your EXTENSIVE menu and DELICIOUS food. Your consistently wonderful service.\n\nI honestly don't understand how Defalco's is not bursting at the seams every time I visit. The place is NOT your typical Italian restaurant. All food is cooked fresh while you wait. The market is always well stocked and reasonably priced.\n\nThe wine selection is SOLID, too, with a diverse range in type and price.\n\nDefalco's remains some of the best pizza I've had the pleasure of consuming in AZ and even though I'm NOT a \"sweets guy\", their cheesecake is my #1 favorite EVER. Always MORE than adequate servings for the price on all fronts.\n\nIf you haven't been to Defalco's, you need to go visit them STAT! Seriously, Defalco's is a total cultural experience you don't want to miss. So find a couple of hours in your week, then go and order in - it's the best way. (But don't forget a bottle of wine on the way out!)\n\nThank you, Defalco's, for being so consistently awesome! See you again real soon.  :)","314986":"Had never heard of this place before my girlfriend Double Dee recommend it after she seen it featured on a food channel network.\nStaying at a nearby hotel, we ordered out and picked up a bottle of pinot gringio to wash it down.\nDee ordered a chicken pesto sandwich on focaccia bread while I ordered a full order of baked zitti which came with a salad and garlic bread.  The food was excellent.","315048":"Dine-In : 3 stars\nTake-out : 4 stars\nOverall it would be about a 3.5 stars\n\nThis is an italian grocery and restaurant which is pretty neat. The sandwiches are usually very good and they have killer focaccia bread.  I would definitely call in your order to go instead of eating in.  When we were ordering at the counter it was hard to communicate with the guy at the register because the other employees were asking him questions in spanish and interrupting.  Not sure why they couldn't wait till he wasn't in the middle of taking an order. I wound up getting mustard on my egg sale sandwich somehow because of it and it wasn't as good as usual. The food also seems to come out in a random order I got an egg salad sandwich and my friend got a ham deli sandwich and he got his about 15 minutes before I did.  The times I have gotten takeout from here it has gone much better so I'll just stick with that.\n\nTry \n- focaccia bread on any sandwich\n- egg salad","315690":"Guy Fieri never steers you in the wrong direction...\n\nWe went here this particular afternoon after watching a previous episode of Triple D and since we were in the Phoenix Metro area we just had to try it out! When you walk into this place it look like a little mom and pops grocery store but when you get to the back where the deli is its like a slice of heaven back there. They have this huge menu that you can choose from with pastas, pizza, cold and warm sandwiches, and desserts to die for. \n\nWe ended up ordering the Veggie lasagne and the Pizza Bianca. I let my fiance decide as I know she is a little more pickier than I am when it comes to Italian or I would of ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs and a sandwich filled with lots of goodies and finished off with a side of heartburn! The Lasagne was excellent. The veggies were fresh and crunchy. The sauce definitely compliments the dish very well and the pasta I think is even fresh! The pizza bianca is basically a margherita without the sauce and Ricotta cheese. The ricotta is so fresh you can definitely distinguish the freshness of it the crust is nice and crunchy and the fresh basil tickles your taste buds as you take each bite of your pizza. \n\nWhat stole the meal was the desserts we ordered. Their chocolate covered Cannoli's are simply amazing and the Tiramisu there, words cannot describe how wonderful it was. I've had some really good Tiramisu over the years and I will say this was the best I've had in my entire life. The ladyfingers were spongy, the marscapone was so good you just couldn't stop and the balance and layers of flavor left you only wanting more. Unfortunately, we stored the Tiramisu overnight at our hotel in Tucson and ate it the next day only to discover how wonderful it was. It was way too late to come back and get more! \n\nOur next trip to AZ we will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu. Overall I really enjoyed everything. Only downsides I can think of is its really not set up to be like a restaurant and its so busy but really worth the wait here! In addition, I forgot to mention the staff here really takes customer service very seriously. Everyone was super friendly and very patient when I explained to them it was our first try and we heard about you guys from Triple D and never once felt like they rushed us or was unhelpful with any of our questions.","315955":"DeFalcos feels like home! It is an amazing experience, from food to employees to the satisfied feeling after anything you eat here! I am new to town and don't like to spend a lot of money on eating out but this Gem keeps you wanting to come back for more. My sons and I make it a point to all order differently as to try many items and I can honestly say have never been disappointed! Cheers to your family DeFalco's & to many more years of continued success, thank you for your passion!","316040":"Ordered the Italian combo and meatball sub. Came out quick and orderly. I didn't see anything special about the sandwiches, they were just reasonably priced sandwiches. I came in right when they opened and 4 people were already waiting at the door.","316237":"We are currently sitting in the restaurant eating as I write this, and I just have to say, this place is incredible.  The atmosphere is wonderful inside- an open deli with an Italian style market on the floor, and a nice little patio outside.\n\nThe owner was personally running the cash register, which I respect because I love when owners show enough care to be working any job necessary.  We were greeted warmly and the owner talked to us for ten minutes or so while ordering and after.\n\nWhen our food arrived it was nothing short of life changing.  We got a spinach salad with chicken and goat cheese that had a nice and tangy Dijon vin dressing which was delightful, a bowl of minestrone soup, and an antipasto salad.  All ingredients used in the salads were fresh, and you could definitely tell!\n\nOverall this place is an amazing experience.  From food to customer service to atmosphere, this is already a new favorite of mine, and I will definitely be returning very soon!\n\nSide note, I read Paul B.'s review and I have to say, we must have eaten at different places.  The owner was anything but rude, and just a heads up, bacon and PANCETTA are definitely not the same thing.  For complaining about the quality of Italian food you sure don't seem to know anything about it.","316653":"I love this place, it was featured on diners, drive ins, and dives and this place is amazing. Being italian we are always looking for the next best thing and this is the closest you will get to fine italian food. Defalcos does not mess around I just wish it was not so crowded all the time","317412":"Lived in the area for a little over a year and frequented Defalcos a countless amount of times. Its worth the wait. Theres not a single item on their menu that you will be disappointed with. I live in Chicago, and DeFalco's is still the best cheesesteak I've ever had.","317942":"Off the chainco's! lol\n\nToday my friends and I pondered what to eat.. a good sandwich was was we decided on but where? Looked right here on yelp and it came up.. most the reviews were good so we went for it. WOW.\n\nI like to ask for a knock my socks off never been here suggestion and he offered up the cheese steak, with peppers and mushroom. I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.\n\nService was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.\n\nI thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.\n\n\nWhile eating my buddy joked the place was off the chain.. and should rename itself to \"off the chainco's\" lol\n\nHighly recommended and cant wait to take others here.\n\n\n-Shawn","318235":"The food here is delicious! Everything from Italian subs to the pizza, legit Italian here. The spot to eat Italian in Scottsdale.","318845":"I've been going to Defalco's for 20 years. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I didn't live or work in\/near South Scottsdale for many years and just rediscovered this place when I moved back to the East Valley. So lucky to be close to it again. The food is always fresh and delicious. I've had many things from here. The pizza's and subs and dinners are all wonderful. The egg sandwiches are to die for!","319120":"The pizza was above average.  The cheese calzone was delicious and the veggie sandwich is great.  The italian bread alone is worth the trip.  Their wines are some of the best we've had, especially for the price. And, the staff are very friendly and accommodating.  \nStop in for a great Friday night dinner.  You won't regret it.","319291":"I think I've easily eaten at DeFalco's 1000 times. I used to work literally next door to their old location. While I was baking brownies, they were making my sammiches. One time, we scuffed up the picnic table that Gerry had just built for his employees breaks. I took about a week off cuz I heard there was a contract out on me. But the sammiches pulled me back in, and I apologized and ordered bologna.\n\nAfter moving downtown and losing out on my sammiches, I started revisiting them in their new, expanded location on Scottsdale Rd. Same great people, same great honest food.\n\nHere are my favorites:\n\n * Boars Head Bologna, sliced thin on Italian roll with lettuce, mayo and swiss cheese\n\n * Ham Cappy on Italian, lettuce, mayo, mustard and dofino\n\n * Chicken Parm w\/red sauce on wheat roll\n\n * the weird salad with penne and peppers and salami chunks\n\nAnd give their pizza dough a chance. It's my new favorite for making thin, bubbly pizzas on a stone at home.\n\nPlease Tony, keep it in the family. Pass it on.","320025":"Always great. The only issue and it's a good one for the business owners to have is that sometimes when you come by for a quick lunch because it is so busy it takes a little while. So we normally just call ahead","320049":"Real deal Italian deli, or at least as real as you'll find in AZ. \n\nMy search for the best cheesesteak west of the ...well, west of Philly...led me to DeFalcos. The sandwich did not disappoint. Can honestly say that their steak fixings (steak, cheese, shrooms and grilled onions) rival just about any I've ever had. Seriously great. The only slight demerit comes from the roll. Just doesn't compare with an Amoroso imo. A bit too bready, crusty outside that cracks easily and makes that steaky goodness hard to handle. I think it would probably be perfect with something like an Italian beef. Probably try that next time. But if you're someone that wants to try a legit cheesesteak, they present a terrific option.\n\nKT had the cappicola, soprassata and provolone on sub roll and rated it a solid 4 stars. Again, she thought the roll a bit \"dense\", but delicious overall.\n\nSides weren't too exciting, more than likely due to our late visit.  Red skin potato salad was the best; mozzarella salad had wonderfully fresh basil and tomatoes, but the mozzarella was not flavorful at all. Very flat.\n\nManaged to have some dessert as well. DO NOT get the chocolate mousse cake. That way there will be more for me! Absolutely fantastic. And KTs lemon bar disappeared in a hurry. Nice cappuccino as well.\n\nVery impressed.","320613":"This is my very favorite Italian deli. The food is delicious and so fresh. Love the pizza dough and homemade sauce!!","320744":"The Il Purista sandwich has it all! Prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, tomato, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. We paired it with the antipasto salad and the side salad. Don't forget the strawberry cheesecake! A delicious Italian feast for sure. I'll definitely be back.","321735":"We had heard about DeFalco's from friends, and stopped in for a late, light, lunch. The Greek Salad was delicious, and we followed it up with a 12\" Pizza Bianco with added grilled chicken. Shop with your eyes while you eat---deli, desserts, wine, all the Italian necessities. Fun!","322362":"So delicious!!!! I've had the pizza, salad, and pasta and have never been disappointed.  Super fast service and I have never, ever had a bad time here. Plus if you're looking for authentic olive oils, cheeses, sauces, and balsamic vinegars this is also the place for you.","322761":"You have got to try this place. I love Italian food and this place did not disappoint. Go there and enjoy it!","322908":"I stopped in here on a lazy Saturday afternoon after reading these good reviews. Service was pretty quick.\n\nI tried the capicolo, salami, and provolone cold sandwich and it was very tasty. Great meat and condiments. I definitely recommend this place and will go back.","323118":"I had not been in here for a year or two. I had forgot just how good their meatball subs are. The sauce they use is the best of any in town I've had.  I usually get my meatball subs at Oregano's or AZSandwichCo , which are good, but the sauce here is MUCH better!  \n\n\nI just wish there was one in Chandler. Maybe they need to expand, since you still can't get into the place at lunch time, unless you've got lots of time on your hands.","323886":"My boyfriend and I had spent way too much time researching good Italian food when I remembered Defalco's. The person sitting next to me on a flight had mentioned it to me over a year ago and I was amazed I remembered the name. Thank goodness I did. This was one of the best meals I've had. The Alfredo sauce was creamy and flavorful but not too think or too thin, and not too cheesy. Even the garlic bread that came on the side was wonderful. The carrot cake was so delicious that I never wanted it to end, and even went back after dinner and bought a slice to take home. My boyfriend loved his linguini with clams and the pesto pasta salad was delicious, though I just tried a bite and we took the rest home. They were busy the whole time we were there but the counter service was fast and our dirty dishes were cleared promptly. We love 30 minutes away but will definitely be back over and over.","323937":"Best meatball sub i've had in a long time.  Meatballs were big and just soft enough.  Plenty of sauce and cheese.  I got a half order and I was so full!  Probably hard to find a seat during the lunch rush and I've heard complaints that they are slow, but  we didn't have any trouble.","324178":"I have never had any pizza, ceasar salad, or chicken parmesian as good as at Defalco's. Somebody once told me, \"quality takes time\" well let me tell you waiting an extra few minutes or so for this delicious meal was WAY worth it. The quality this place puts out is like nowhere else I've ever eaten, no other place that outshines it, can't wait to go back!","324307":"I had an Italian sausage with peppers sub for lunch. Everything you would want! Not too spicy sausage, green and red peppers cooked just right, lotsa marinara sauce, all on a fresh hoagie. And a single pepperoni on the side. Felt like I was back in the North End. Yummy! And although the line was just under ten deep: they got it served PDQ.","325069":"I work close by and a friend recommended them.  i have been there 1-2 times a week sense.  Everything I try is great.  Don't be in a rush though.  \n\nI use to drive 20 miles to get a good Italian Beef sandwich with spicy sausages.   Now I just go 5 minutes for a great one.","325257":"The fiance was showing me her favorite places when she lived here and this was the first stop! She raved non-stop about everything and I finally had to try it. I got the egg salad sandwich and we split the tortellini salad. Man, the salad was out of this world. We've been craving it since we got back. I can guarantee the next time we are in her old hood, this will yet again be the first place we check out. Thanks Defalco's for cranking out some great food. The cashier was also very friendly and not pushy!! Thanks","325551":"Ok boss, here goes in Italian then...Presentandomi avevo detto anche che ero con un amico italiano, sarebbe stato adeguato porre pi\u00f9 attenzione alla cottura della pasta. Siamo arrivati verso orario di chiusura, non abbiamo voluto chiedere di cucinare di nuovo per noi. Per quanto riguarda gli ingredienti del sugo, gradirei conoscere quali sono allora questi ingredienti che al mio palato ricordavano origano e rosmarino. Comunque la nostra recensione non era del tutto negativa ( 3stelle ) ma giustamente critica per migliorare il servizio di un ristorante\/grocery italiano. Capito?","327942":"Great place for lunch, along with their outstanding deli salamis, prosciutto, homemade Italian sausages and different cheeses. Had the Italian sausage with peppers and onions. Friends had the corned beef sandwich in the eggplant parmesan. Everyone said they were delicious.","327998":"Great to see a place on a tv show from the local area.   This food is unique to the area and excellent quality.  Highly recommend.","328832":"Excellent wine selection at unbelievable prices. Wish I lived here. Would frequently come in!!","330546":"Walking into Defalco's feels like Marty McFly stepping out of the DeLorean and walking into 1950's Hill Valley.  Most of the menu offerings are right out of any Brooklyn corner italian deli circa 1950.  This place is the antithesis of a soulless corporate chain.\n\nI prefer the hot sandwiches - today's lunch was an eggplant parm sandwich (about $8) on a crusty roll.  To tell you the truth - just about everything\/anything tastes awesome when placed on a toasted roll and smothered with thick marinara and melted mozzerella - but even so - the eggplant parm was awesomely great.  Happiness on a plate.\n\nMy only complaint is the randomness of line\/wait time to order - which can vary from zero (today, Monday at 11:50 am) to seemingly forever.  The wait time is so unpredictable - about half the time I pop in at lunchtime I immediately turn around 'cause I don't have 15+ minutes to kill waiting to order.  But of course - that line tells you everything you need to know about this place.  The people have (correctly) spoken, and they gives two thumbs up to Defalco's.  One of my 'regular' lunch spots - and it should be one of yours, too.","330753":"The Italian sub was very good. The set-up to the place is a little confusing for a first timer. I took some homemade sausages home but I won't repeat. Not bad but there are better to be had.","331142":"Impossibly good Italian deli in the middle of the desert. Huge sandwiches on the most incredible bread you've ever had outside of NY. As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll.\n\nI should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.\n\nI dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.","331188":"well gabi you said it they are SLOW and i don't think the sandwiches are that great plus all the employs seam to have this attitude that your taking up there time like they have something else to do there product selection of Italian goodies seems pretty good but way over priced the one thing they have that i really like is there feta cheese which i use in my spanokopita the other day when i stopped in for feta i decided to get a sandwich... meatball,I said to the guy can i get an xtra meatball on the sandwich .......guy.....snotty....you can get whatever u want ,oh OK f u then i went to the front counter i told the guy there i would like a pound of feta he kinda shook his head in disgust i guess because there were 5 people behind me waiting to order food to go and i had the gull to order feta so he yelled behind the window CAN SOMEBODY GET ME A LB OF FETA FOR THIS GUY OUT HERE .......f u.......I will think twice before i give this establishment any money again","331321":"I typically employ a \"generalist\" strategy when eating out, trying something new each time, unlike my husband the \"specialist' who will find one thing he likes and never waver. Defalco's meatball sub forces me to break my pattern. It's so good I've never tried anything else here! Last Valentine's day, we celebrated the weekend before and on our way to our outside-of-town date activities, we stopped by Defalco's for meatball subs! Red meat, cheese and tomato sauce spells romance for me apparently. \n\nYou can eat-in amid the grocery shelves, but we generally take it to-go.","331777":"YUM! Great place for a hearty sandwich, fresh pizza and the best macaroni and cheese ever. When you walk in the place looks busy with all different types of pastas and sauces you can imagine. The menu is posted on the back wall along with cold cases filled with homemade sides and fresh meats and cheeses. If you're smart, call ahead and have your order ready when you arrive because the wait can be long during peak times. I love how you can grab a beer from the cooler or a bottle of wine to share on a cute date. I haven't had the chance to buy the fresh pizza dough, but will get on that pronto! Make sure to get their stamp card (spend $5 and get a stamp) for some future savings- trust me you'll be back!","332512":"This is for the tall thin guy working the phones and counter who always makes it a challange to order.  I wonder when he will stop it or just go find work he likes.  \n\nI know he has been there a long time and everyone I talk to about the business thinks he is a problem.  I think maybe the capacity is just not there for him to know the menu and it is easier to make the customer sound like the idiot.  It is really a shame they have this guy working the front lines. \n\nI ask for the itallian and he says, \"which one we have a lot of Italian sandwhiches.  I order a cheesesteak the way I order them in Philly and he gives me a hassle on that.  He actually asked me where I was from and told him Philly. What is the use for the attitude... right?\n\nI copied and pasted the sandwhich I just tried to order.  It looks like the only Italian and it is first on the cold sandwhich list.  \n\nItalian Combo \nHam, Salami, Pepperoni, Mortadella & Provolone","332652":"It breaks my heart...alright, that's an overstatement, but it does make me sad, that the food here is slipping.\n\nThe lasagna has not been the same since the first time I ordered it and reviewed it so glowingly; every visit I always get the spaghetti (and by the way, the one time I ordered meatballs, there was too much breadcrumbs.  Wait, what?  When does that happen?) has been mediocre at best.  The last six visits-that's SIX visits - it's not hot enough.  Look, I \"can\" the busboy it's not hot enough, but he doesn't know saute'.  Apparently, neither do the cooks. The chef?  Management?  No one's home.  Look, I know it's deli masquerading as a restaurant...but it's still supposed to be a restaurant.\n\nThe lasagna, which I thought was awesome, the spaghetti is cold...why am I going back?\n\nThat's the tough part about the restaurant business: every single day is \"SHOW ME\".","332859":"Amazing food and deserts no matter what is ordered. We have tried hot sandwiches, calzones, pastas, and a chocolate gnocchi cake \nSo yummy!!! Would recommend this place!","332978":"This is my go to spot for any type of Italian food. The fresh mozzarella and tomato\/basil sandwich is amazing and the bread is always warm and fresh.\n\nMake sure you bring a book or something to occupy your time because this place is always busy. The wait can sometimes but 20-30+ minutes and seating in the summer is always difficult.\n\nIf you are able to save room for dessert make sure and pickup a slice of NY cheese cake or maybe even a rainbow cookie.","333473":"This review is long overdue. My GF and I probably eat here 2 to 3 times a month. If we are struggling to think of a place where we should go for lunch this is our spot. There really isn't a lot on the menu I don't like. I love the Corn beef on Rye but they have mazing cheese steaks as well. If you live in the Old Town area and you haven't tried this you need to rethink your priorities.  If you have just moved to town or you're visiting, you need to make time for Defalco's.","333930":"finally got a change to come here, I ordered the Italian sausage sandwich and my wife and daughter got some salads since they didn't have anything gluten free for my daughter. \nthe bread was perfect and so was the sausage, only thing I wish it had more cheese, next time I would order it again but with the peppers and onions. Lots of cool food things to buy also.","334376":"We ordered two sandwiches: Chicken parmagiana and Eggplant parmagiana.  The chicken was cut into chunks not as a cutlet which caused the meat to be a little dry.  The eggplant was good and they gave me extra sauce on request.  They seem to have a nice turnover so everything seemed fresh.  Being originally from NY I know what good marinara sauce is (a 10) and this is about a 7.5. But I must admit it is better than most of the ones I have tasted in Phoenix\/Scottsdale restaurants.  They are definitely nice people and they do their best to serve you quickly.  I would only return if I were in the area.","334909":"Excellent sandwiches and just about any other Italian grocery item you can mention!\n\nEasy parking and friendly people too :)","335458":"Believe the DDD hype. The calzone was perfect. Pizza was great. Service was some of the best and friendliest ever. They do not rest on their laurels. A must try.","335585":"Went early in the morning and picked up a couple of sammys to take to the ball game.  Not sure - maybe it's the best Italian deli in the area, but didn't try any other so can't say that.  I can say it's good maybe even a little better than that, but coming from NY\/NJ very tough for me to give it a 4 or 5 star rating.","336014":"Had heard great things about Defalco's and wanted to try it out.  We arrived and got in line.  There were only about four people ahead of us in line, but the order taking was going VERY slowly.  They finally opened up a second register.  The girl took our order, we paid, and went outside to sit.  After about 15 minutes or so they brought my husband's cheesesteak sandwich.  We had ordered some additional food to take to someone at home and he said that would be out shortly.  I asked about my stuffed shells and he said they were not on the order.  I went back up to the counter and the girl who took our order apologized and said it was totally her fault and that she had never placed the order for the shells.  She charged me, I paid, and she rushed the order.\nThe shells came out pretty quickly, but by that time my husband had already finished his sandwich.  Luckily he decided to eat the piece of caramel fudge cheesecake he had ordered to eat at home later, because when he opened up the cheesecake box he discovered they had given him a regular cheesecake instead of the caramel fudge.  Again we went up to the counter to get our order corrected.  Instead of telling us to keep the regular cheesecake, they actually took that from us and then gave us the correct one.  I'm sure they just threw it in the trash.  Given the multiple errors with our orders it would have been nice for them to offer us to keep it.\nOverall the food was good, but the issues we had with the service made our dinner less than satisfactory.  Hopefully this was just a fluke, but not sure if we will risk it to try again.","336279":"WOW!! This place has solid Italian food! you can eat there or get it to go but either way you're making a great move by eating here! I had the chicken pesto and it was amazing! they also have a great wine selection!","336402":"Love this freakin place. They maka da meatballs from scratch eh. The red sauce is freakin delicious. My friend tony the torcherer loved it! After a long day of mafia hits this is the only I repeat only place to come.","338413":"We love this place every time we come it the food is on point !!!!! Being from back east I live a good crusty Italian sandwich roll it's always perfect here. We had the Maximus and eggplant Parmesan  sandwich amazing","338939":"Had to downgrade after a recent visit...\nOrdered the Purista to go; took ENTIRELY too long and when I got home to eat it, I was shocked at how skimpy it was!  And NO flavor either...had to dig through my pantry for some salt, pepper and balsamic.  There was exactly 1.2 oz of mozzarella on the sandwich (I weighed it) -- so I added some of my own to make it a REAL sandwich.  Should've. Just stayed home, huh?","339244":"Well, I have come here several times now. It is a grocery and a restaurant. While it is supposed to have the feeling of the Neighborhood store. I just don't feel it.\nIt is nice ,the food is good, but it is not great.\nThe grocery food items for purchase have dust on them. I do not like that at all. It creeps me out a bit. Living in AZ ,I know Dust comes in from every direction. But, that is why you have to clean it.\n\nIt is a great location in Scottsdale. I do love their Mozzarella and the sauce they use for the restaurant meals.  However, I am just not blown away with everything else.\nIt is good though. We are in the Desert and it is hard to find really good Italian here. Although Las Vegas seems to have it down. Maybe there are just not that many Italians here. So they do not need as much great stuff. \nI do find Romanelli's to be much better. More Neighborhood like in it's feel.\nIt is worth checking out though.You could definitely do worse.","339449":"My boyfriend and I are obsessed with Defalco's. It's less than a mile from my house so we frequently eat here. Everything we have ordered thus far has been amazing, flavorful and fresh. \n\nI believe that the owners' family originally came from Italy, which explains the atmosphere of the deli. It reminds me of a typical european deli, mixing fresh foods you can order to your liking, along with a small selection of groceries and specialty items.\n\nI like to buy certain groceries here but they are a little more expensive, given that the majority are imported. They've got some great products - fancy cheese, a giant selection of olive oil, unique pastas (gnocchi, fusilli), and lots of wine. \n\nTo date, my boyfriend and I have tried: \ncheesesteak (must try it!!! get it on the Italian roll with grilled onions, mushrooms, and peppers), \nchicken parmigiana sandwich, \nitalian sausage sandwich with peppers (homemade sausage, i would recommend adding cheese),\ncheese ravioli,\nartichoke and vegetable lasagna (amazing!),\ncaprese salad (homemade mozzarella cheese!!), and \nspinach, avocado and goat cheese salad.\n\nWe are looking forward to eating everything on the menu, but it is always difficult to try something new when everything we've tasted has been amazing.\n\nDon't forget about ordering desserts! Tiramisu, cannolis, chocolate eclairs, lemoncello cake... I have a sweet tooth and I am happy to report that they do not disappoint.","339553":"I was in town for the NASCAR race and from this place from a local resident, who recommended this place. It did not disappoint and exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Italian Cold Cut sandwich and the four cheese lasagna, which were fantastic! The place is a quaint Italian market and market the offers a wide range of sandwiches, pasta and pizza. When in the area, this is a must place to try.","340312":"Very good sub.  Bread might have been a little stale, but it was still good.  For people who complain about the wait... shut up and order a beer.","340368":"Yes the sandwiches are better than most in Phoenix, but this is a terribly organized establishment.  35 minutes for 2 sandwiches to go?  Please.  We've been to lots of delis and italian grocers that are more crowded and have less personnel, and they all find a way to run smoother than these guys.  We won't be back... food isn't that good.","341564":"Love this place but know that it's going to be packed and you will be waiting. \nI've had the meat lasagna which I loved \nI also buy my Italian deli meats there.","341804":"Can't go wrong with a single item on the menu. Their pizzas and cheese steaks are my go to orders though. Great food.","341864":"Very good homemade sandwiches, salads and Italian delights. Good selection of wines to stay or go. A Scottsdale staple.","341986":"Everything I've eaten is amazing! Very authentic Italian food. Not a lot of space to eat in the store because it is a grocery store too, but great to take home and eat with the family. I've purchased meat sauce from here for pasta and just saved the rest for other meals.","342198":"I cant give more then three stars at this point. However on my next visit it will probably update to a five. when ever I try a place I like to have something simple. This time I opted for the roast beef Sub , with lettuce tomato, onions and mayo. It was pretty darn good. I also had a chocolate cannoli, the cannoli was a five. Next time I will try the Philly with mushrooms. Look for my Update. Be patient it takes some time to get your food.","342702":"Obsessed. I found DeFalco's recently driving home from work and was not sure what it would be like on the inside or what the food would be like. I had heard it is great authentic Italian food so I new I had to try it. I'm Italian, so I know when it is real!!! Since my first time trying DeFalco's, I have been back at least once a week. \nI got the Penne with Vodka Sauce the first time which was amazing. It came with garlic bread and a side salad which were great as well. The next couple times I have gone I got the pesto pasta salad from the deli area and I love it. I always get it to go and keep it in my fridge but it only lasts me about a day because I cannot stop eating it. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for REAL Italian food like your Grandma used to make!!","343175":"Both my cheese stake and my wife's lasagna with a small salad and garlic bread was amazing. Both of us thought it was the best we had, had in a long time. The staff were very friendly and were very out going truly showing pride and ensuring that customers knew theypp were number 1. The inside was extremely clean the staff were on top of ensuring that tables were cleaned as soon as a customer left. We also ordered desert I got the chocolate eclair in my wife Delhi New York cake. Those as well were outstanding extremely fresh. We will be coming back we drive from far West Peoria  so it's a drive so that should show how good this place is.","343228":"Amazing food! We went today (Saturday) for a 1:30 lunch and we must've gotten there between crowds. You can shop for what you want to take home while you wait to get in viewing distance of the on-the-wall menu board. The line moved quickly and once we placed our order, I think our food was at the table within 15 minutes. We ordered full portions of ziti and chicken parmesan because we wanted leftovers. Both came with amazingly tasty seasoned garlic bread and a refreshing side salad. We could've easily gotten away with half-portions, but now we have dinner for the next few days.  The ziti had a marinara\/cheese\/cream sauce, so yummy, and the chicken parmesan was a full-on tomato sauce that perfectly complimented the chicken which was easily eaten with only a fork. We had to stop well before we'd eaten half our entrees to share a chocolate shell canoli, which was out of this world. I think I'm going back next weekend. The only drawback is that all your food comes out at once: salad, bread, entr\u00e9e, dessert. But it's a small price to pay for perfect.","344468":"House salad is very good no ice berg lettuce. My fettuccine Alfredo was delicious. Everyone at the table agreed the sauce was fabulous. The cypress salad was fresh and tasty. My friends had the meat lasagna which he said was good. My other friend had the gnocchi pesto which she chowed down quickly. All with garlic bread. Yum.","344918":"Il puritan and the eggplant artichoke salad make your tastebuds just dance. Perfect place, food is fantastic. Service is exceptional and the speed of their service is why this might be one of my favorite Italian delis.","345409":"Seating can be an issue, but it's well worth it. I always get the chicken cheese steak and love it everytime. I've been to Philly for the Pat and Geno's experience and this place is right up there with them. It has a small neighborhood market feel with all the uniques Italian grocery items you can buy there. One of my go too's for lunch!!","345653":"Best Italian I've had in Phoenix! The half portion of the pasta alla vodka fills me up and is usually my go to. It includes garlic bread. My friends love the steak sandwich. It's a cute grocery store with a lot of imported products from Italy. I also would recommend the chocolate covered cannoli.","345967":"Had a Half Cheesesteak of French Bread (Excellent) with Onions & Mushrooms (Skipped the Bell Peppers) - I think I'll see if I can had a few Jalape\u00f1o slices next time. Wow, it was great! I'll be back!!","347272":"We were in Scottsdale for another happening and wanted to try this place out. I had seen that Guy from Diners, Drive Ins and Dives had been there. My husband had the same homemade sausage with peppers sandwich that Guy had. He added provolone cheese to it. The pricing on that sandwich was very affordable! I ordered the Purista and it was fantastic. We shared an order of red potato salad. I would def go back again!","347702":"Absolutely my favorite lunch spot. I've had everything on the menu and every time I go I have a tough time picking!\n\nMy recommendation: the chicken cheesesteak. My favorite: eggplant parm. \n\nBut seriously, EVERYTHING IS GOOD.","347834":"Un@$%!ing believable cheesesteak! \n\nI just want to admit something, and I'm not ashamed about it. I went to DeFalco's two days in a row for that sammich. Seriously, it's that good. From the bread to the perfect amount of cheese, it's definitely the best cheesesteak sandwich I've had in the 5+ years that I've been here in the valley. The only thing that upsets me about it is that now I'll have a hard time trying some of the other items on the menu.\n\nFrom the reviews I have read, a lot of people have long waits when eating here, but I did not. I think if you can work around peak restaurant hours, you shouldn't have much of a problem. Also, the staff was pretty nice to my group and me. \n\nI'm addicted. There I said it. DeFalco's brings the East to the Southwest, and it does pretty perfectly. It's a must if you've moved from back East and want a little taste of home, or if you've never been out that way and you want a little taste of what you're missing.\n\nBravo!","348101":"Went back and tried DeFalco's last night, a to-go order. I decided to forgo calling in the order to avoid the same thing happening as the last time. I walked up to the counter and am relieved that the guy I dealt with the first time was not taking my order. After the long day I had had at work, I was not prepared to deal with him! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I was shocked as I was asked what type of bread I'd like. That question was not asked of me over the phone for the first visit. \n\nJ's sandwich - Whole cheese steak with everything \nMy sandwich (went for something different this time) - Half eggplant parmesan \n\nOnce again, the sandwiches were AWESOME! The bread was nice and soft. So soft in fact that the sandwich was falling apart on J. But he enjoyed every bite. He said for next time, he's going for just a half sandwich. But, I'm sure DeFalco's leftovers are just as delicious!\n\nDeFalco's redeemed themselves!  :D","348444":"Great food.amazing meatballs. Awesome portions for the price. Service left something to be desired","349684":"For horrible service. The food is delicious but if they know they have a busy lunch hour they should hire someone with good customer service and have multiple people answering the phones, not just one!","350915":"Ok de falcos is a staple place in this neighborhood. The Philly cheese steaks , cannoli  and cheese is authentic and really good. \nHighly recommended to anyone who likes authentic Italian grocery stores.\n\nHas a quaint and homey feel inside and a solid patio with a good wine list! \nLove love lveeee itttttt","351273":"Great good, good price, casual small market atmosphere. Definitely a unique and worthwhile place in Scottsdale.","352593":"Food is great! Just would like the parmigiana dishes were smothered in tomato sauce,(I will ask next time) The Italian Combo best one I have has since I moved here from NY. I always rate a great Italian restaurant by the meatballs and sauce, they passed the test!","353031":"When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie, that's...Defalco's.  It's hard to find a good deli, and after living in New York for six years, it's almost impossible to find one that matches up with the Big Apple.  We walked in, and the first thing to come to my mind was, \"Where to you order?\"  As you walk in, the grocery store is the main focus, with Italian spices, snacks and the best part, wine, filling the store, I wasn't sure what I was in for.  The ordering counter for the sandwiches is in the very back, not to be mistaken for the deli counter right next to it (though after looking at the selections, you can be assured that I'll be back for that too.)\n\nThe selection ranges from a multitude of sandwiches, to basic Italian pasta dishes.  It's always nice to not have to meander through a menu when you are hungry.  Along with the two people I was with, our order was placed.  The prices seemed very reasonable, and we also were able to order a beer from the counter.  I ordered the Italian Sausage sandwich with roasted peppers, one friend got the chicken parmigiana and the other copied my order, but with cheese.\n\nThe dining area is very simple.  One are is designated for tables while other areas happen to have tables in areas throughout the store.  We sat down, and to our amusement, they had three flat screen TVs up for people to watch sports.  It's playoff time, so we took in the AFC Championship game.  Our food came out rather quickly when one of the guys from behind the counter came out and called our number.  (Note: keep your receipt after getting it because they right your number on it.)\n\nI dug into my sandwich like an Ethiopian into a Big Mac.  The sauce was wonderful.  Rich in flavor, it had a certain spice that brought out the perfectly cooked peppers and the sausage.  The sausage was perfectly cooked, but to my dismay, there was only one sausage in it.  Now I have to admit, I love Italian food, and I might be a little soiled for my time in New York, but I was hoping for a little more.  My friend who got the Chicken Parm let me take a little sample (sacrifice for the good of a Yelper) and I would give it two major thumbs up.  Sauce good, chicken good, pasta good.  I got a little jealous, but don't get me wrong, the sandwich was awesome.\n\nDefalco's is a great place for a quick bite or even an intimate evening for a couple who doesn't want the hassle of a restaurant.  The food was good, and though I might have had issue with the portion size, that could be me just being a large man wanting more of a good thing.  I would also recommend Defalco's for those of you who would like to make romantic dinners at home.  Italian food is very easy to make, and who could deny Lady and the Tramp as a wonderful representation of Italian romance.  One thing for sure, this Tramp would take his Lady to Defalco's.","354077":"Great selection, family owned vibe and the stuffed pasta shells were fantastic. The gnocchi wasn't my favorite but I am extremely picky on texture for that dish so.. It would have been difficult to win me over. I will definitely be back though!","354706":"Bread is amazing, all around. From the pizza crust to the sesame seed bun I grab for my purista. If you're a fan of olives make sure you grab some as well.","354753":"Just moved to scottsdale and decided to try this place out! The roast beef sandwhich was good but the ambiance is what really did it for me. They had this east coast deli vibe going on and I loved the sound track they were playing. The italian soda was amazing. It teetered on the almost to sweet side but definitly made an everlasting impression (carmel creme flavor). Great place to get a good bite to eat although the items on the shelves (ie pastas tomato sauce cookies ect) seemed alittle over priced. I will definitly go there again.","354849":"Came here with my hubs as we waited for the oil in our car to get changed. The atmosphere is pretty typical to a regular deli, but there was also a nice positive vibe (probably because of all the happy full customers).There was a bit of a wait getting to the register and a solid wait after we ordered but it was totally worth it!\n\nThe cheesesteak was the best I've ever had! And my hubs sandwich was super fresh and delicious! \n\nIf you have time to wait and savor the deliciousness of their sandwiches, go!","354856":"I was told by the cashier that it would be a 40 min hold for 1 pizza.\n40 minute hold times??????\n\nThe place barely has any room to stand or walk around in.\n\nI ended up leaving and checking out another local Italian shop.","355180":"Let me start off by saying the food here is delicious and authentic. My only gripe about this place is the long wait times. I waited about 40mins this last time. Other times I have been here are shorter, but still longer than other places. I've had the centurion calzone and meat lasagna and they are delicious. The calzone's bread has a just baked feel and the mozzarella cheese is amazing. A ton of flavor is packed into the calzone. Really you can't go wrong with this choice. I enjoyed the lasagna and it tastes like you would expect it to. One of the better lasagnas that I've had. I also tried the tiramisu and it was rich but not overwhelming. Very airy and chocolatey!","356577":"We went to Defalco's after going to Italy, and were mostly looking for the Italian Lemon Soda that we had on our trip that we can't find back in the US. While they didn't have Lemon Soda, they did have delicious Italian food. It is order at the counter, and they have a few tables inside.","356645":"One star for crappy customer service. I told the cashier girl, literally 20 minutes ago as I post this, that I wanted pasta salad. She said which one...I said I don't know the pasta salad with meat and cheese (it wasn't labeled correctly!! And everything in the fridge is all over the place). So I took a guess at which one since it was under that label..I ended up with tortellino salad (or however you spell it)  instead of what I wanted. But is it my fault it's on the wrong label..she wouldn't even take 3 steps over so I can point to which one. Common sense that if a customer continually points to what's in the fridge and says I don't know the name (because I was quite sure the label wasn't correct), why don't you as an employee take 3 steps over so we can both make sure we are correct. Don't just ask me what it says..because I was hesitant as fuck because I didn't think it was correct since the fridge looked a mess, either way i said the label it was under. \n\nAlso add more milk substitutes..first of all milk from a cow is disgusting and gross and filled with hormones, so no one wants to drink that.  Add almond milk, soy milk, or coconut.","357267":"Defalco's is a great place to get Italian sandwichs, I especially like the meatball sandwich, but the lasagna is great as well.  Cheesesteaks are good and could be the best in Phoenix, but Pats in Philly is better.  I have Defalcos on my speed dial and I recommend calling in your order to be picked up 30 minutes later because that is how long it can take to get it when ordered there anyway.  Well worth the wait though.","358164":"A homey Italian grocery. Moreover a wonderful Italian restaurant. Nine of us (kids and all) went in. All were raving about the food. And nobody left with a feeling less than full. The star at the table(s) was the calzone. A feast in and of itself. Even their regular coffee any large chain's best. We will be back again.","358497":"Love love love this place! I have had dinner here twice and will continue to go. It's a small little store which also has a restaurant inside. You order your food and someone will bring it to you! I love how quickly they bring out the food, but most of all how delicious it is. The whole size comes with salad as well as some garlic bread. I have tried their mac n cheese, stuffed shells (super good), and lasagna...they all tasted yummy!","359235":"Funny set-up but great food.  People were eating all different types of menu items.  I ate the meat lasagna which was very tasty.  This place had a lot of customers getting take-out.  Looking forward to trying their pizza next time.","359505":"Based on high Yelp reviews and recommendations  from others finally decided to try this place. After waiting in line 15 minutes I ordered the Italian Combo to go.  Waited another 15 min for them to prepare and off I went.\n\nOmg this thing was the same horrible sub you'd get at a Subway or Jersey Mikes franchise! \n \nTo start, what they call \"toasted\" is just warmed up.  The sub roll had the same yellow grains on the bottom that cheap pizza chains use to prevent their genius cooks from burning the crust. It's actually corn meal and should never be used on bread since it's disgusting. \n\nThe puny amount of meat used on their sub was laughable. I asked for Italian dressing and they must have barely put on a teaspoon.\n\nOk I know I should've just tossed this thing out the window but hated the idea of wasting 10 bucks. Took my first bite and it was so dry I nearly choked on it. That was enough for me, into the trash it went along with the zero-flavor, dried out  brownie I ordered.\n\nNo way I can recommend this place for sub sandwiches or deserts.  Perhaps the pasta is good but not taking my chances.\n\nThe only reason I can give 1 star is that their to-go napkins are nice and high quality (thank goodness too, I needed something strong and absorbent to hold the sub and brownie that I spewed  out).\n\nCiao DeFalco's!","360474":"Seriously the best deli in Arizona! The sandwiches are made with quality ingredients. The prices are reasonable. I go out of my way to get a sandwich from this place. Its a must try...you will be hooked!!","361562":"Couldn't say more about this place, drove by it by chance, this place is the real deal! Fresh meats, cheese, bread, sausage, imported prosciutto, Italian cooking products like pasta sauce antipasto the list goes on. I ordered a prosciutto with tomato fresh mozzarella and pesto on a fresh crusty bun it was outstanding!!  Arizona does Italian food better than it does Mexican food!","361566":"Wowza. Wanted to try everything here, but ultimately went with the beef cheese steak with peppers mushrooms and onions as rec'd by the girl working the counter. Next time would love to try the il purista and the pizza. The sandwich blew me away, but 5 stars also for ambience and service. Really cute market & can't recommend highly enough!","361893":"Absolutely amazing I've been going here for several years never been disappointed!! Food is amazing and affordable","361939":"Defalco's is hands down the best place to eat in metro Phoenix. I have lived here for a little over two years and am always trying to find new places to eat, yet I have not found a place that tops this. Suggestions for newcomers: any of the pastas (love the baked ziti with sausage), any of the sandwiches (cheesesteak, chicken park) and the calzones. Did I mention they also have some of the best sausage available? I usually swing by and get a sandwich then end up picking up a few links to take home. I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!!!!!","364277":"Cheese steak sub was one of best ever. Lived in Philly for years and can't believe that this actually beats any cheese steak there. Located in an Italian grocery store \/ deli. Great atmosphere","364530":"Five for the food.  One for the service.  I have been coming to this place for a long time, probably 15 years. The story is always the same.  Great food and terrible service.  My girlfriend and I have been treated poorly as a couple and as individuals.  Every time I come here I am treated poorly by the staff.  So much that we usually get our food to go, just to minimize contact with the staff.  Even with this strategy the older man at the to-go register is a giant Jerk.  \n\nEvery. \nSingle. \nTime.\n\nI've spoken with the owner, he was very nice and said he would correct his staff and even picked up our lunch.  That was super nice of him.  I believed it would all be handled.  Next time we came in, no owner, same rude service.  So for the fourth time after our chat Mr DeFalco the service remains...hostile and rude.  I'm sorry Mr DeFalco but your restaurant is officially dead to me.  And I'll be sure to tell all my friends.","365004":"I had the eggplant parmisian sub thing. Holy god. I've only been there once and it was a long time ago but I remember thinking \"Why am I such a super-human moron? Why don't I eat here regularly?\" \n\nStrangely, God responded. Some joke about me falling down the tree and hitting every branch. You know how it goes... \n\nI did not experience the extreme wait times that other people mention but that would really annoy me depending on my mood. Yet another reminder I'm not self-actualized.","365326":"I got a half size spaghetti with marinara and boy oh boy do I wish I got a full size!! It comes with garlic toast and both the spaghetti and the bread were singworthy A M A Z I N G!!! \n\nBoth such simple things but made to perfection. Will definitely be coming back for seconds.","365806":"Be still my heart. I loved this deli grocery. Saw it featured on Triple D and put it on the must try list. Good food, great desserts and huge selection of  grocery items, many of them I have never seem in my Italian grocery in Florida. I had the sausage and egg half sub, my hubby had Salami capocolla full sub, fresh and tasty and we shared a limoncello cake that was special. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. We would definitely go back for another foodie experience.","365815":"I have been here twice now to eat and grab some goodies. The sandwiches are really good and very nicely priced for what you get. My favorite is the italian sausage but I have also had a cold cut and tried my daughters meatball and they were fantastic as well. We bought some risotto to make at home and my daughter made it for mothers day with some tiramisu with ladyfingers she bought here and it was all amazing. Their supplies are fresh, and good quality. Great little place!","366200":"Walked in not knowing what to get at all. The cashier dude said to me that I should get the Philly Cheesesteak because it's the best in the country. I told him that's quite the hefty statement and chose to go with the Italian Combo sandwich and also told him I'd give the ol' Cheesesteak a shot next time. This guy seemed to know what he was talking about. I then decided to grab a side of two of the pasta salads and try them both. I also got a side of their marinara. My bill total was $19. So cheap!\n\nSo I take the food home and I am really expecting this to be absolutely amazing since the reviews on this place are off the charts. And...the hype is real amigos. I tried a bit of everything and I couldn't find one thing to complain about. I hate going to hyped up places because I'm afraid they'll disappoint but I stand by this hype. I'll be trying that Cheesesteak next time!","366272":"Oh, how I miss Defalco's!!!! My saturday's were not complete without an eggplant parm sandwich. The chicken caesar pasta salad is delicious as well. It's all great and homemade. Waiting in line (there always is one) is so painful because you just want to eat everything. The aroma of the place is insane. The hot sandwiches take a few minutes and I am quite antsy but they are very worth the wait. They also stay well. I would always have to take half home and eat it later that night or the next day (sometimes even cold). Regardless, this place is sooooo good!!! I found it hard to find good authentic Italian anything and this was perfect!!!","366652":"First visit and it was great.  Not too busy when we got there on a Sunday morning.  The wait after odering was decent and they were nice enough to put the Daytona 500 on for is.  Wife had a half order Lasagna and the kid had a half order fettuccine with marinara and a meatball both good.  I had the beef cheese steak with provolone and grilled onions on baguette.  I meant to ask for a side of mayo and was about to when I took a bite.  Didn't need it.  Awesome amazing flavor.  The au jus soaked into the bread that was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Very good food and a great experience.  We will definitely be back.","366785":"Best Italian in Scottsdale\/Phoenix. So yummy! I'm always going to go here for some authentic italian.","367471":"This place is THE best place for Italian Deli sandwiches in all of Phoenix (but located in Scottsdale) the bread is incredible! It's definitely an institution! Just GO!","367841":"I have been going to Del Falco's for years. And I have never never been disappointed with the food. The wait can be long at times but that's a testament to how good this place is. Give yourself plenty of time for the pizza and the calzone. Portions are large. Especially the full calzone. It will take you 4 meals to eat it. The groceries are very cool too. There are some Italian things there I've never seen. Makes me want to have a dinner party. I absolutely love this place!","368461":"This is my 3rd time (I think) coming to DeFalco's. The first time I went with my husband for lunch. We both got salads, which were huge. I didnt even finish half of mine. They both were good. My husband loved his. I couldnt finish mine and it was pretty good.. probably get 4 stars that time. \nThis time when I arrived 11\/2011\nThis time, I was irritated, because I got a sandwich and it was OK not to great and not something I would ever order again. The reason I am writing is the guy behind the counter seemed shady. He seemed like he was doing something he shouldnt. When he rang me up, he acted very weird and I didnt get it. When I got back to my office, I found out that the sandwich looked half made and there were no utensils or napkins. The whole feel was weird. I am not sure what was going on, but felt like he just threw the food in unmade and non tasty. I will give them another chance and still give them 3 stars, due to the first time, having good salads.","368647":"Amazing salads and Italian cooking supplies! Salads, pizza, wine, oils, and desserts are my favorites from here.","368807":"I'm so in love with this Spot. Best Italian deli I have found. The pizza  is great! The sandwiches are so delicious . You may want to order a head because seating is limited and the wait can be long because it is so yummy everyone wants to eat here.","369722":"I've been going to Defalco's since 2007.  If you are looking for a great sandwich that won't break the bank and taste delicious then go here.  Fresh Italian ingredients, friendly staff, but most importantly their sandwiches are really amazing!  I always get the chicken pesto sandwich.\n\nThey offer beer, soda, water... and also have an authentic Italian deli.  One of my favorite places in the Scottsdale area.","370133":"best chicken parmesan i have ever had. and they have lupini beans :) will be back soon!","370509":"This is my husband and mine favorate place to go. We love the food and stopping in for stuff as well.","371274":"I love this place. It's authentic. Excellent selection of Italian delicacies. It would be 5-star if they had Italian chefs in the kitchen--rather than cheap import chefs like the rest of AZ.","372645":"Great Italian deli and market. Everything we've had there is great but my favorite so far is the fettuccini alfredo with chicken. Yum! (Hot roast beef sandwich is a close second- get extra au jus!)\n\nThe staff is great and there's always a line out the door for good reason.","373453":"Great place for lunch off Scottsdale Road, close to Papago Park. Has a full menu for food, but also some grocery and deli items. Really good sandwiches. If you are going for lunch, you may want to call ahead. It gets very busy, and takes awhile at times. Called ahead today and they had my order ready right when I got there.","373951":"Second favorite Italian deli in Arizona! Friendly staff, amazing food, huge selection! Only deli I enjoy more is Guidos at Scottsdale and Shea, but that's besides the point. Be sure to call in your order around lunch time as it tends to get really busy! I would recommend Defalco's to anyone looking for a great genuine Italian deli in the area!","375095":"Amazing Italian food!  I had the four cheese lasagna and my husband had linguine and clams. Both were delicious. We took desserts to go. This place is wonderful!","375189":"This place is a hidden gem. We had the pizza and cheesesteak and both were delicious. They have a nice beer and wine selection as well. Can't wait to come back and try a salad and pasta.","375587":"Great grocery for tons of Italian goodies and desserts. Calzones are amongst the best I've ever hard. Prices are fair and the 10 inch calzone is large enough for feed 2.","375718":"Upon sinking my teeth into the Il Purista sandwich, I was filled with a sense of fear...\n\nHad I just bitten into the best sandwich I'd ever tasted? Would  I never find another sandwich that could compare? Can I eat this sandwich for the rest of my life?\n\nThe answer was Yes. \n\nAnother favorite here is the Chicken Parmesan. This is by far the best marinara sauce I have ever had, smothered on the best breaded chicken breast on this earth.\n\nThe grocery is neat, a bit of a novelty, and seating is sparse. I enjoy sitting in the more private section to the right of the entrance. Prices are fair, and you can split most entrees between two people.\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone seeking authentic Italian cuisine!","376014":"Such a great find...so thankful to my friend who introduced me to Defalco's. It's an Italian deli\/store that also serves up a full menu of food. I usually order ahead and either eat it there or take it to go as during lunch they get very busy and you usually end up waiting for your food for quite awhile. The prices are soooo good and they make everything fresh. Check out their deli counter with their fresh salads. Love the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich. I get my sandwiches on their sub roll. When I ate meat I'd get the same sub but add prosciutto. Drizzle EVOO and balsamic vinegar and you are ready to get your grub on. Oh yum, their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is a large amount of tender chicken in their homemade red sauce covered in melted mozzarella...what's not to like about that? Their pastas and stuffed pastas are fabulous; eggplant parmigiana and stuffed shells are great! The pasta dishes come with a side salad and garlic bread. This has a comfortable family feel and it's always fun eating here, I would definitely recommend it!","376614":"We love the authentic food and amazing groceries you can't find anywhere else!  What a treat to have a taste of the east coast right here in Scottsdale!","377152":"Unbelievably and deliciously good food.Lots of imported ingredients from Italy, very fresh homemade pastas and best of all low prices with very big portions! Will come back again when in the Phoenix area!","377277":"Food is great! I usually order a pasta or sandwich and have tried the pizza. The pizza is not as good as the pasta though. Also they sell pizza dough and have used there dough to make pizza at home! Easy to order and casual atmosphere is my type of place when looking for a quick lunch or dinner. I've never done any shopping here but have been tempted to buy some wine. I highly recommend this place if you want a sandwich or some really good pasta.","377841":"Always a favorite! General thought after leaving is that I need to come more often or back soon. Can get busy but they have a pick up window if you call in","378444":"Late one night in Food Network's Diners Drive-ins & Dives I heard Guy talk about this Italian deli and tuckedvit in my grey matter.  Having a week of Cactus League baseball I took a break and stopped in for pie. Found heaven for sure. 12 inch pie made to my specs was amazing. House red wine vinegar olive oil dressing was perfect. Assortment of wines from all regions is sure to please you palate. Eat amid the bottles for a treat.","379208":"Great sandwich, good price, outdoor seating is a plus as well.  \n\nI do wish I could have seen the menu prior to getting to the counter to order (it's cramped and the menu is posted on the wall behind the counter so you can't see a lot of it until you're up on the register).  Also, the outdoor seating is very tight as there are probably 3 too many tables out there.  \n\nAll of the food that came out looked delicious.  I had a sandwich this time but look forward to trying the pasta next time as it looked great.  \n\nThe grocery area is great and I picked up some old Italian favorites after lunch.","379514":"The Sweet sausage is best in AZ. Sad that's all I will be buying from now on. This place is in desperate need of an Adult Manager. I ordered one simple item and watched an almost 30 year old bearded infant walk around aimlessly for 20 minutes yawning with the real almost 50 year old manager that openly complains hid in the back.  Sad Andreloi is a longer ride but they have better food and service.  Never again!","380264":"Awesome Awesome Awesome! We are in love. This place has the best sandwiches & food for someone craving an east coast excursion of Italian! They have a full service deli & grocery, so you can take & make your own Italian creations if you want. I got sausages one night & it even made my cooking taste good! The prices are amazing too. For about a quarter more than you'd spend on your \"five dollar footlong\" you can get the real deal. If you want food in a super hurry, go somewhere else. They make everything after you order, so you might hafta wait, but the seating is set up well. You can still feel tucked away & watch TV until they bring your food over. I turned some friends from Connecticut onto it & also some other New Yorkers....now get your butt over there & eat some real food!   :)    PS, their chocolate (mousse type) cake will change your life!","380381":"Everything is pleasant here from the people to the ordering to the taste of the food. \n\nI've had a Philly Cheese steak in the heart of Philadelphia and it didn't even come close to the heavenly sandwich found here at Delfalcos.Also, its HUGE! I couldn't finish mine but it was even good heated up the next day. I cant wait to come back to try their pizza and some more of their salads. \nThey also have a large selection of wines, pastas and various other snacks so Its a great place to do some shopping for home while you wait for your food to be prepared. \nThe owners are great, really cant wait to come back for more!","380611":"Only ordered one thing off the menu so far, but the mostaccioli and meatballs is absolutely fabulous. Highly recommended. The sauce is phenomenal, meatballs taste just like mom used to make, and prices are reasonable. Definitely check this ace out if you haven't yet.","381155":"Super cute little shop. Perfect place to go for a lunch sandwich or a bowl of pasta for dinner. It is pretty expensive but you get what you pay for. I recommend this place","382679":"It had been a long time since visiting DeFalco's. We had just come from the Scottsdale art festival and this place is fairly close by. It is a restaurant\/grocery store with seating indoor and outdoor. We ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and the chicken Parm sandwich.  It was quite crowded when we were there but the service was quick and the food was nice and hot. On the chicken Parma sandwich the chicken was a little overcooked. Otherwise everything was good and we enjoyed our meal.","383065":"Tried the Italian beef sandwich w provolone and it was simply amazing. The provolone is perfectly aged, the sliced beef roast is juicy and flavorful, the baguette roll was fresh and crispy and the au jus was delicious. Looking forward to trying their pizza next!","383072":"Had the Italian sausage hero, it took 20 minutes before I got it. It was dry just a small sausage with hardly any sauce. Staff was not friendly. Won't go back again","383144":"I was looking online for something to eat nearby me and this place had great reviews which drew me in the check out the menu. I had been craving a Margherita pizza for a while so I decided to just give them a shot and ordered the Pizza Margherita with grilled chicken. I went and picked it up and found out that Defalco's is basically half restaurant\/half true Italian grocery. I have been into making homemade pizza lately so the grocery really excited me. I have decided I will come back in a couple days to pick up some of their authentic ingredients for a homemade pizza night! Anyways, I got home and the pizza was great! I love how thin the crust and the mozzarella was amazing! Great little spot that I never would have even noticed if it wasn't for Yelp","383395":"I haven't been to many other delis here in the valley, but I would go ahead and say this one is among the best.\n\nUpdate: This place is still amazing...I literally can't get over it","383987":"My go-to place for anything Italian. Just so happy that it is close to my place.\n\nTo be honest, dishes of Andreoli in the McCormick ranch is a bit better, but for the price and proximity, Defalco is great enough.","384037":"Other than an occasional excessive wait time the quality of product here is unmatched. Defalco's has the best grinders and cheese steaks around, plus they offer fine-dining quality pasta dishes to eat here or take with you. They also have a mini Italian grocery with a variety of meats, cheeses and olive oils.","384045":"Ate there for the first time on a Thursday, went back on Friday! Big servings and amazing food & service... I have never been disappointed!!","384167":"Delicious every time we come in or get Togo! We love the chicken Parmesan, the Italian sausage, and the gnocchi... but you literally cannot go wrong with anything! Their sauces are all fresh, but red is our fave! We each had full portions of chicken parm, salad, chicken cutlet sandwich, a cannoli, and bottle of Cabernet all for $40!!! You will. It be disappointed with this choice!!","384184":"Awesome place. Had the \"purist\" sandwich. Ingredients were super fresh. Flavors were all in balance. No overloading of basil or peppers. And LOVED seeing that they had local wines for sale - caduceus and merkin.","384468":"This place is a great NY\/East coast style Italian grocery store that offers a wide variety of pastas and sandwiches.  I've been coming here since my ASU days and found Defalco's to be a good deal for the money and taste for sandwiches.\nI almost always get the sausage sandwich or the baked penne as they have become staples of my visits there.  Recently, I tried the pre-made pizza dough ($1.99) that only requires rolling out and baking.  It takes a little effort, but the results were spectacular.\nThe only downfall is there can be a bit of a wait to get helped (which they now have signs up for this) and their actual groceries are quite pricey.  There are some decent deals on anything that is pre-made, but the wine, pasta, sauces, and deli meats are pretty high on the price scale.\nThis place is a great place to grab a bite to eat, but don't buy too much of your groceries here unless you are looking for that true Italian ingredient to make your recipe exactly like in Italy or some rare item that can't be found anywhere else.  Otherwise, it's definitely worth stopping in and at least looking around.","384967":"Pretty good food, slooow service. Waited 27 minutes for sandwiches.  Yep, just sandwiches and nothing else. \nMy concern is that there are several reviews where the service seems to be their biggest problem, yet when people are going on Yelp and telling you how to improve, you even have a sign at the counter stating hiw you encouraging good service, you would think they would be able to take the advice to heart.","385735":"This place is simply awesome Italian food. I get the sausage sandwich or the cheesesteak!","385849":"In a town full of expensive, yet mediocre food, Defalco's Italian Grocery is a local gem. I will say that I think some menu items are better than others... The first time I went, I ordered a margarita pizza and was not very impressed. But luckily I decided to give it another shot. They have amazing desserts and sandwiches. To be fair, I am vegetarian but some of my favorite items here are the grilled veggie sandwich (make sure to specify your bread at the register or they will select for you), the vegetable and artichoke lasagna, the caramel fudge cheesecake (it's literally unreal...), and the lemon ricotta cookie. Once you find an item you love on their long, extensive menu, you won't stop coming back to Defalco's. The prices are also amazing. A whole portion (they have whole and half) tends to be at least 2 meals for me. They also have a great selection of cheeses and grocery items such as frozen pastas and ice cream. Definitely check this place out!","386467":"Fantastic deli, with tons of Italian specialty sandwiches and salads.","386627":"I'm so glad I finally made the trip and it did not disappoint! We ordered a pepperoni calzone, meatball and garlic calzone, Caesar pasta, tortellini pasta, Greek salad and strawberry cheesecake. The food was amazing, homemade and fresh. I recommend this Italian deli to anyone in the mood.","386691":"After reading so many positive reviews, my husband and I had expected better Italian sauce than that which accompanied the signature Italian dishes such as lasagna.  However, the sauce was over-cooked, almost to the point of having a scorched-like flavor - perhaps masked with sugar since it was overly sweet, as well.  The lasagna itself was decent.\n\nThe meatballs were bland with a mushy texture.\n\nPerhaps, since we are from Cleveland - home to some of the finest Italian restaurants in North America -, and because my husband has labored for years to perfect his family's spaghetti sauce, we're too finicky.  If so, I apologize.","386735":"I have been to Defalcos about 4 times, I really like the atmosphere, it is relatively comfortable although kind of small and I have only been there at off times so they have not been busy. They do some times take a long time to fulfill your order though. \n\nI have only had the subs there, can't say a deli is the place for pizza. Had some of their cappuccino  and  I can say their food is good but not great or anything to really rave about. Actually I found their cold subs are better than the hot ones. The hot ones are rather bland to my taste and really lacks anything special especially the bread and I have tried 4 different types, there is little seasoning. The subs ingredients are plentiful, they do put a lot of quality ingredients and yes they are better than the chains so they may be a couple of dollars more, it is worth it. It really is good or a little better than average and I do not consider the chains average. All in all, I would recommend it for their quality and also they have a good  plentiful selections. Does not blow me away and I usually like it here\nfor the atmosphere also, so the two combine is not bad.","386805":"Phenomenal food! The wait is a little long but it's totally worth :) fantastic people and environment!","387312":"Love love love it! I had the half combo, which is a sandwich on sourdough w\/Salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Provolone and I asked them to hold the ham- comes with their house italian, lettuce, mayo and mustard. Absolutely delicious! After I finished the 1\/2 sandwich I decided to be daring and grab a piece of the cheesecake, which was to die for. I haven't had a slice of homemade cheesecake in a long time. \n\nThe staff was so nice and friendly and the locale was very clean and tidy. I think I found a new fave spot.","388248":"This place is very strange.  The atmosphere is more like a foreign grocery store than a restaurant, but the food is really good.  OK, I have only ever tried one dish but the other food looks really good too!  They have a large selection of unusual salads and the desserts are always really tempting.  They also have sandwiches and pasta.  I keep meaning to go back here, but it is a little out of my way in general.","388607":"This place is the bomb diggity. \n\nFor almost three years now, I have been searching for a deli comparable to my beloved Zanotto's in NorCal. I have been lucky enough to go toe to toe with some pretty good sanwiches, but nothing has been able to really feel as good as Z's. \n\nOne of roommates heard through the grapevine that this little neighborhood spot had a big lunch following for sandwiches, and today we found out why.\n\nWe dropped in and I ordered the lunch special, a turkey avocado and mayo sandwich on sourdough with some nicely blended tater salad. \n\nNothing will replace Zanotto's for me, I'm afraid, but this is far and away the closest yet.","388629":"The best Italian food that I have had since coming to Arizona plus's all the Italian groceries you could need","388796":"As Dean Martin sang, \"That's Amore\", thats exactly how I feel about this place! I just tried it for the first time after seeing reviews on Yelp. I absolutely loved it, I tried the cheese steak and got a side of the tortellini salad. I'm not gonna lie, I havent ever tried a cheese steak sandwich until I went here and I have fallen in love. I went with my parents, and my fiance and we were each in heaven. My cheese steak had everything on it, and it was so yummy. I was worried the bread would be too hard, so it would be hard for me to eat.. but my worries went away as soon I bit into my sandwich. It was the perfect hardness (wow that sounds a bit scandalous), not too hard but not too soft.  The tortellini salad was good, but I wouldnt say great.. next time I'll have to try a different salad. My mom whose had many cheese steaks in her life, swears this is the best she's ever had anywhere. My dad would not stop raving about his meatball sub. My fiance got the 5 meat sandwich, and really enjoyed it as well. In my family we are big dessert eaters, so of course we each had to get our own desserts. In our group we had the canoli, caramel fudge cheesecake, carrot cake, and the taramisu. Each and every one of our desserts was so good! I will definitely be back here, to top it all off the service was great and our food came out pretty quickly. My mom had a bit of a shopping spree in the grocer section, so I knew she was very pleased with this place. If you're in the area, you will definitely need to check this place out. I will write an updated review after I've tried the pastas.","389568":"Great place I've been going to since I was a Kid.\n\nI usually buy the over the counter meats and get a prosciutto sandwich to go, but the Calzone (massive at more than 16\" wide) is good with their great selection of deli meats inside.\n\nNever been unhappy with anything i've got there.  \n\nGood Italian wine selection as well, and AMAZING bread!","390127":"Great Italian deli....I love the hot sandwiches. Pizza is good too","390162":"Great place for lunch!  Their menu is huge, there is so much to choose from. Sandwiches, pasta salads, salads, etc. Their grilled cheese is amazing.\n\nOnly criticism is that they need more seating!","390968":"This place is a little, not so hidden anymore, gem. I first saw it on one of my all time favorite shows Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. And if it's good enough for Guy Fieri it's perfect for me! It's such a cute little grocery store with all of these treats and ingredients straight from Italy. There's so many types of pasta and wine to choose from it's almost overwhelming but in such a good way. \nI've had just about everything on their menu and everything is always so perfect. So flavorful and mouth watering. \nThe subs, the pastas, the pizza and the sides everything is wonderful and so well made. Plus it's family owned so you know it's made with love. \nTheir dessert selection has a few different options everyday but the baklava is always my go-to it's so good not overly sweet, perfect combination of flaky from the pasty and sticky from the honey it's fantastic. \nIf you live in Arizona and have never been here you MUST try it!","391238":"Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!\n\nBut I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.","391261":"This is a great place for sandwiches. I had a cheesesteak last time I was there and it was great. The cheesesteak here is made with mushrooms, peppers, and provolone cheese. Everything I have tried here has always been very good.","391439":"Finally! A place close by that sells conoli shells and sweet potato gnocchi! \n\nI had the tuna salad with a white and milk chocolate cookie. My boyfriend had the gnocchi Alfredo and a conoli. I would have posted a photo of our food but we ate it too fast ;) \n\nI will definitely be back to try the lemon bars.","392120":"Absolutely OUTSTANDING.\nCool little place\nCool people\nYummy cheesesteak \nYummy yummy yummy cheesecake!\nWill come again","392655":"Love this place! The meatball sub is out of this world! Homemade meatballs swimming in homemade marinara sauce on a crusty baguette. Don't forget the pizza, the crust alone is so tasty, buttery and herbacious, then add all the tasty creative toppings and you've got a pizza masterpiece! I love getting fresh cannoli's for desert or a couple of Baci which mean 'kiss' and are little dark chocolate hazelnut truffles.  No matter what you choose, I'm betting it is all good!","393683":"This place is good no matter what you have to eat. My family and I come here every time we go to the zoo. Their portions are huge and you can share just about anything. If you are looking for really good Italian food then this is the place to come to. My wife an I split a calzone. My kids get the Mac and cheese every time we go and it's their favorite Mac and cheese anywhere.","394185":"La Lasagna de carne con 4 quesos muy buena, el lugar muy agradable, muy buena la comida, el vino, buena variedad, el trato amable y lugar limpio. Adem\u00e1s venden muchas cosas.","395329":"I've been going to Defalco's for over 5 years, and I've never been disappointed.  The place feels a lot like a typical neighborhood Italian grocery and I like that.  The food I've ordered has always been delicious (and I say that, having ordered nearly every sandwich on the menu) and it's always made in a reasonable amount of time.  They're not \"fast\" and they're not overly friendly or warm, but that's okay.  I usually don't stay there to eat anyway; I usually take my food to go!","396440":"Oh dear lord.... Thank you for the meatball pizza from De Falcos. Put it in your mouth. Right now.","396595":"Never seems to amaze me with how flavorful their food is. We went with the lasagna. So good and plenty of taste to go with the serving size. A half order is probably a good size for an average two people. The whole always end up having extra left overs. Which I will never complain about.","397048":"This place is very cramped. The gal at the ordering counter had an attitude, didn't give me a copy of the credit card receipt until I came back to get it. The tables are too small and there is hardly room to get to the station where you get soda, water and silverware. I prefer to dring water with my food, but the water tasted funky. Oh yeah, when we got our food, they didn't bring any silverware, so I maneuvered over to the station and they were out of forks. So I had to go to the pickup counter and ask for forks for my wife and me. The glass of wine I got (Chianti) was very stingy in quantity and bitter. This place is so tiny that we didn't feel comfortable talking because our business would become everyone else's. We ordered eggplant parmesan and spaghetti and meatball. Meatball singular is what you get, pretty lame. Prices are too high for what you get in this no-frills place. Some inconsiderate employee was hogging the restroom way too long. On the plus side, the food tasted good and they did include garlic bread and salad. But the salad came at the same time as the main dish, so that does me no good. I don't think I'll return, at least not for dinner, maybe lunch or for pizza to go.","399215":"I saw this place profiled on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives last night, and it looked amazing!  I only live about 2 miles away from it, and not sure why I've never been there before.  I went today, and there is no doubt that I will be a customer for life.  I bought a bottle of wine, and Il Purista sandwich.  The sandwich was fantastic!!!  The meat, veggies, and cheese couldn't have been fresher.  They give you several options for what kind of bread you want.  I got the seeded sub roll, and it was perfect.  Soft and tasted great.  I'm already planning my next meal at Defalcos! :)","400016":"This place is a must see. What on the menu do i hate? That would be a short list. I love the calzone, I love he sandwiches (just get it on a roll), I love the salads. I get my pork roll there and my olive oils. One and the frozen pasta\/ravioli!! I could go on about this place forever. A must see!","400078":"Terrible customer service most of the time.  Nonetheless, we can't resist the food.  One of the best meatball subs around for a cheap price.","400198":"The food is magnificent! It's just tastegasem!\nThe gnocchi, the salad and the connoli is awesome too.\nThe service is very good and the food hard ready very quick. They have order pick ups too, in case you're in a hurry!","400567":"YUM!!\n\nWent back tonight, got the baked Ziti, Wifey had the lasagna... wonderful.. took the mother inlaw, she loved it as well... AND we have left overs too!","401820":"Happened to visit this place for lunch. Don't think you are lost in a grocery, the restaurant is along with the grocery store. The place was really packed when we entered. \n\nWe went ahead and ordered angel hair pasta with clam sauce and chicken pizza. The pasta was really light, well cooked but was expecting a little more sauce it was too dry for my taste. The pizza was one of the best I have had. The sauce was delicious and perfect amount of cheese and toppings. We also ordered Cannoli for dessert, the filling was fresh, light and tasty. The crust was alright. \n\nI would definitely want to try their home made sauce and long list of sandwiches.","403173":"Got a couple of dishes and only thought it was okay. Glass of cab was tasty though. Wanted to fall in love with this local joint but I didn't. We tried the French dip w Italian sausage sandwich and the spaghetti and meat balls. Meats in sandwich were dry and lacked flavor to me. Pasta dish was \"normal\". Will only be back if other company suggests it.","403242":"Being from Brooklyn NY and being spoiled my whole life with the best heroes NOT SUBS in the world, I can honestly say that Defalco's is pretty decent for being in Arizona where there are no good heroes bc nobody knows what a hero is pertaining to food.  The roast beef with fresh mozz and au jus sauce is excellent.  Bread could be a bit better, but overall a good experience.  KInd of overpriced tho (and thats coming from a NYC hero eater).","404243":"Best little Italian place around!!!!!! Great sandwiches, great pasta, great desserts!! Everyone is always so friendly! The place is always busy but never have a long wait. I love the tuna pasta salad and the cannolis!!!!!! 5 stars for sure!!!!!","404982":"2\/27\/2107 - Tonite I ate lasag\u00f1a at DeFalco's and it was DELICIOUS!  Next time I'll take it to go, maybe heat up it more than they did. \n\nTall, like lasagna is supposed to be, wonderful Italian sausage. I haven't had lasagna this good in 10 years. In fact, writing this review now it occurs to me I'll go back there again tonight. \n\nWhat better recommendation can you give a restaurant than \"...I'm going to go back again and again\"?  \n\nDeFalco's occasionally has a misstep but I'm telling you this is a solid, solid pick!\nAnd great lasagna!","405243":"I just have to tell you that this place is amazing. Not only is the food top notch so is the service. It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!","405249":"I love Defalco's! We have so many great memories there, however I don't like taking my kids there because of all the amazing stuff that is everywhere and I don't trust my little ones to keep their hands to themselves (I have little ones). \n\nBesides that, I love their sandwiches, their pastas, and pretty much everything. I think I switch it up overtime I go there. Unlike my hubby that orders the same thing every time. I think he orders the Meatball sub every single time. It can be crazy busy and super chaotic - which is a bummer for people like me that can't make up there mind and it's kind of cluttered, so when I just want to browse I feel like i'm bumping into people. But that is what makes Defalco's Defalco's! The place is great. Check it out!","405370":"Uh, friggin' awesome deli turkey sandwiches -- by far, the best in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area.  For the amount of \"real\" turkey that you get, they load on the extras (tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, honey mustard, etc).  A big sandwich for $7.50. I'd gladly spend an extra $2.50 then have to settle for Subway, etc.  I highly recommend DelFalco's chicken pesto sandwich and pizza.  Huge fan -- just wish they opened another one near Mill Avenue...\n\nRead Giovanni T's review -- he hit it on the head.","405855":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but our wait really hurt the experience. First, it is a little confusing to know what to do when you enter. It isn't immediately apparent where you can go to order food. No problem, just go straight past the shelves of wine until you see a register. Ordering is quick and easy and the cashier was great. \nMy parents ordered just before my wife and I. All of us got a toasted sandwich of some sort, but my wife and I got paninis, which apparently take a while. In fact, people that sat down 5 minutes after us got their food first. My parents were done eating before we got our food, and we ordered right behind them. I understand a short delay, but this was pretty extreme. \nThe food, however, was amazing. One of the best paninis I've had. The ingredients were great, and I'd more than happily have it again... just don't make me wait for it.","406856":"Philly cheesesteak never disappoints, DeFalcos makes this sandwich the best! Meatball sandwich is awesome as well. Everything on the menu is very good. Since my last visit they have improved seating and restrooms.","406918":"The line goes quickly! My grilled veggie sandwich was absolutely delicious on a toasted baguette. The menu is extensive!","408918":"Delicious sandwiches!  I've been here a few times and have had the meatball and cheesesteak sandwiches. Amazing!  The cheese they use on the cheesesteak really makes it.  Also have had the antipasto salad and it is huge!  Wife and I had to take the extra home for leftovers.  Only drawback is seating is very limited. There's an outside area so that probably helps when it gets a little nicer out. I'd try off peak hours.","408995":"super cute inside, so delish & didn't even expect it to be that great at all \none of my top south Scottsdale places for sure","409841":"Favorite sandwich shop in Scottsdale! They always have Fresh bread, meats, and toppings! The wait can be quite long at times and there is always a long line around lunch time. The wait staff is not always the friendliest and sometimes won't acknowledge you're waiting at the counter until they're finished working on what they were doing before you walked in (cutting meat, filling the cooler, etc..).","410503":"Visited from out of town after seeing on Triple D's food network and it was great ! \n\nSmall looking place with a grocery store so not your traditional type of joint. You walk up order off the menu and wait for your food... So worth this find !! \n\nLots of options but here is a sample. \n\n\nOrdered the pizza with the homemade sausage and it was fantastic. $12 for 12\" and $1.50\/topping\n\nChicken pesto was so deli$$h and not bad price \n\nCalzone was Huge and lots of ingredients ($15) The Marinara sauce   ...yum. \n\nGET Dessert !! Had the New York Cheesecake and it was DA Bomb.com. ($3.99\/slice) \n\nLoved this joint - great price , great food.","411311":"The best place around for quick italian food. I've gone twice so far and both the italian sausage and the meatball sandwiches have been great. When you wait in line you'll get to take a look at all of their desserts and they are hard to pass up! I got the chocolate eclair and it was nice and fresh. \n\nBe prepared for a line during lunch because this place is rightfully very popular. The seating is pretty limited but it seems most people take it to go so it's not an issue.","411316":"Authentic grocery deli and restaurant...great staff and the best Philly cheese!!!!","411409":"I had a Defalco's prepare two appetizer trays for an upscale cocktail party at my home. The trays were not only impressive to display on the table, but the variety and quality of cheeses and meats were outstanding. One of the trays inlcuded bell peppers filled with delicious pesto sauce for dipping with the huge order of sliced italian bread included. There were over 20 guests at the party and the amount of food was more than ample. I also thought the price was more than reasonable to feed that many people. Perfect price and quality for any event.","412856":"South Scottsdale treasure! If you don't mind a short wait this is one of my favorite lunch spots around. Great staff, great food, laid back atmosphere... highly recommend","412910":"Awesome little Italian place. I highly recommend the beef Philly cheese steak. Been coming here for years. Sometimes it can take a very long time to get your food (even if they're dead) but i keep coming back for their great food and good prices.","413169":"Went here for my 58th birthday for the first time, we were going to do something upscale and thought no this has been on our list and the food is amazing, you eat within the grocery store but it has charm and the flavors...OMG!  Don't miss out!","413191":"Absolutely awesome!\n\nHad the Italian combo a side of anti paste and a Lemon bar. Each and every time was excellent. \n\nWill be sure to be coming back often!","413469":"Been coming here over the years, never disapoints. Fresh imgrediants and friendly staff. Best red potato salad in town. Get there early as they get very busy.","414889":"So far I've had the calzone and the steak sandwich. Both were absolutely amazing. I really want to visit this place until I find something that isn't 5 star quality but I have a feeling I would have to catch them on a rare bad day. Its quant and if you get there 15mins before 12 then you're out pretty quick. And the pastries are insane!!","415361":"Worst Italian Sub I have ever had... Without a doubt it is disappointing to wait so long for a sandwich that is made with old, cold bread & dressed like the cook has never eaten a sub. So maybe their main courses are good but run, don't walk to another sub shop.","415683":"My coworker and I decided to try Defalco's out after hearing it had been on Drive-in, Diners, and Dives. I read the reviews and knew it was best to call our orders in. Boy was I right. There was a huge line and 2 girls arguing over who was first. Exciting. \n\nMy coworker ordered the Centurion calzone and really liked it. I ordered the panini grilled cheese. I love a grilled cheese but not that one. Too salty. But we both loved the marscapone lemoncello cake. \n\nI will definitely be back to try something else. Oh and the staff was super friendly.","415903":"It was good. The Calzones are HUGE. They caught me off guard. I was told the sandwiches and pizzas are good. Cool spot and good, but it didn't knock my socks off.","416196":"This is one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale AZ.  We've enjoyed everything we've tried.  Some of our favorites include their fabulous pizza and the baked ziti with meat balls.  My children enjoy their sandwiches and desserts.  Great family environment, good wine and beer selection.  Love it.","416528":"Simply amazing Italian.  I love that they have family history, and the store layout is more of a grocery with tables shoved into nooks and crannies, vs a restaurant layout.  The quality of their grocery items are unique and truly Italian.  I've spent some time over there, and this is the real deal.  You could have a field day in here if you wanted to cook a special dinner.\n\nYes, the wait was a bit for ordering at 2pm (it wasn't packed).  But the food...the food shut me up it was soo delicious.  The portions are enormous, so you get really good value for whatever you order.\n\nOne weird thing though: I clearly stated the YELP discount for 1 free cannolli, and the cashier looked at me like I was crazy and charged me for it.  The cannoli was probably the least satisfying part of the meal.  Other than that, I'd come back for sure.","416542":"Coming from the East Coast, I don't think the food here is all that impressive. For instance, the sub sandwiches are on the dry side. The bread isn't toasted and there isn't enough seasoning in the sandwiches. Also, the wait can be long.","416742":"Drove 5 hours with family after seeing on tripple DDD. Food was fantastic. I don't like Alfredo sauces but their chicken Alfredo was unbelievably fantastic as well as their subs. and marinera sauce. My family and I will be back. This is highly recommended.","416796":"Fresh, delicious food, outstanding staff in a comfortable restaurant\/grocery store deli setting. Doesn't get any better than this!","417710":"Went yesterday for a late lunch with the family (only three of us).  Was really excited to try it after reading the recent reviews, ended up being extremely disappointed with the staff and food.  Won't be back.","417801":"Eclairs to die for! The word foodgasm does not even begin to describe the feeling I got with the first bite! i just want to drown in the filling! \n\nAlso- the II Purist is delish. \n\nEvery time I go I give their herb infused olive oils the googly eyes but never end up taking it home. lol I will one day!","417947":"Been coming here for 5 years and have LOVED it. I was so disappointed today. They switched bakeries and the new bread is horrible. The bread used to be so fresh and delicious. It was dry and not good. I won't be going back","418311":"Love the traditional Italian food and deli. All the food options are excellent . Hats off to the cooks and staff. Portion size is good as well and he staff is friendly. Love the authentic Italian olives and quality products this place has. \n\nFrustrating part is speed of service. No sense of urgency. Trying to get in and out on an hour  lunch break even when it's not crowded is close to impossible. A place this busy should have multiple cash registers and quicker service taking  in new orders.","418732":"This place is awesome. I eat here probably once a week on average being my place of work is a block away. Every employee iv dealt with there has been really nice and more than helpful. The food is amazing...and im not the biggest fan of Italian food. It does take awhile for the food to be made but they have been great at making that known, and what do you expect from good food? This stuff isn't frozen. Its quality. I suggest you place your order before heading there so your food will be ready and waiting for you.","419123":"YUMMY!\nQuality and Simplicity are what make great Italian Food, they have those two important factors down!\nTheir sandwiches are delicious! The meats they have are par to non int the city. One of my favorite sandwiches is the 'Capacollo , Hard Salami & Provolone' on their outrageously wonderful white italian sub roll! I usually go for wheat, but I make the exception here, it is worth it!! \nThey are also a great Italian grocer for all your Italian, fresh pasta, pizza dough, wine, italian goods, etc...\nThe prices are reasonable and you won't be disappointed! This is truly a little Italian gem in the desert. and very casual and low key, but delicious!\nI highly recommend Defalco's!\nP.S The wait wait can sometimes be long, but it is worth it! If you are in a hurry, CALL AHEAD!","420439":"The best Italian deli in Arizona. Go Here!","421140":"I think I died and went to heaven. I had the most tasty grilled portobello w wilted spinach, goat cheese and roasted red pepper w pesto on focaccia. The focaccia was soft and warm. I thought I could only eat 1\/2 of my 1\/2 but NO!! I inhaled the whole thing plus a wonderful pasta salad w fresh crudit\u00e9s!  For dessert....YES a chocolate cannoli with a sweet cream filling. Yum!  Everything looks so awesome in the market. Yes you eat among the groceries or outside if you like. The menu is expansive just need to figure out what I want next time!","421714":"I only come here for their ready-made pastas to go. My favorite is the chicken cesar pasta - Yummy! I suggest you call in your order because the wait times can be long.","423028":"Great Italian with out all the fluff. I will hit this place up again. Had baked ziti with sausage add meatball. In addition to to of their handmade salads. This place is a most for lunch hit it up but make sure you are hungry.","423230":"Beautiful place but bad service; they weren't even busy.. I ordered my food for takeout and they said it would be ready in 10-20 minutes. My food was ready 45 minutes later. \n\nI sure hope they fix this problem because I like going to DeFalco's! THE FOOD IS SO GOOD!","423253":"Il Purista Sandwich and small centurion calzone\n\nYou could not ask for a better Italian deli in a major city like Scottsdale, AZ . When you step inside, you forget your in the dessert. Industrial racks stacked with pasta and canned tomatoes provide a cozy atmosphere that provide both a isle for the ordering line and dine -in area for patrons. We arrived just after 11 am on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded at first. As you walk in you are warmly greeted and ushered through the ordering line. On your right you can order up a fresh cup of espresso or imported Italian beer. If you make your way to the left you come to the ordering counter where everything on the menu is displayed on the back wall. They have a glass case with fresh pasta, mozzarella, and cured meats on display.\n\nI immediately checked on Yelp to see what others had ordered and one in particular caught my eye (J P.) Great recommendation!\n\nIl Purista is a classic Italian Sandwich with your choice of Italian bread, fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and a generous portion of prosciutto. I wasn't blown away, but it did meet my standard of fresh ingredients and taste.\n\nThe Centurion calzone was amazing! I'm a big pizza fan and this one had the WOW factor, served on a pizza pan with a side of marinara sauce with chunks of meatballs. The crust was perfectly baked, crispy on the outside with just the right amount of chewiness inside. Italian salami, mushrooms, peppers, and basil combined into a very warm and savory pocket of goodness.\n\nRecommendations: Definitely try the calzones, Pepsi fans will be extra delighted that the soda fountain is extra sweet. I actually refilled my small drink 3 times. Next time I might try some of there fresh pasta's.","423457":"I've been here enough times to write a review, so here goes. \n\nShort and sweet:\nI have had the Italian Combo, the Il Purista, the Italian Beef, the Proscuito, and Italian Sausage and Beef. Every single time I've had a sandwich here, it's been the best I've ever had. Every time!! The bread is delicious, the beefs are delicious (not over salted), and the fixings are always fresh. Their cannoli changed my life, it was so darn good. The service is always fantastic. They give me great suggestions every time I order and the food never takes more than 15 minutes to arrive (usually ten min). I absolutely love this place and consider it my favorite sandwich shop! Five out of five stars!!","424430":"I feel strangely guilty that I am \"cheating\" on the love of my life, Panozzo's in Chicago, but here it is: I love Defalco's. I have tried only a couple of things here, but the main goal for me was that the equivalent of the Prosciutto and Fresh Mozz sammy at Panozzo's is delicious, and it is. At Defalco's, it's called the \"Il Purista,\" and it has - in addition to the two main components listed above - fresh basil, roasted red peppers, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and tomatoes. It is served on deliciously crusty but also soft-on-the-inside bread, and it's less expensive than you would think for such high-quality, fresh ingredients. \n\nMy husband also loved the chicken parmesan sandwich and the cheesesteak sandwich. I have yet to determine if they make fresh pizza dough, pesto, and pasta, hence the 4 rather than 5 stars. \n\nI will most definitely be back.","424504":"Best Italian deli around Scottsdale. Excellent food & worth the wait & price. Can be very busy & have waited a long time to get my food.  The food tastes so good that I am happy to wait anytime.","424562":"I stopped in around 3 pm during the week. Perfect timing. No wait and very fast service. Love the Italian market that is intertwined with the restaurant. Very casual. Walk up ordering. Great variety on the menu. I ordered the gnocchi with red sauce. It was perfrct. Not too doughy or chewy. A good sized portion for the money. I ordered the meatball as side. It was delicious. Just like back home in Ohio!","424669":"Amazing food every time. Perfect place for meeting with friends to catch up. Never disappoints.","425122":"I've been to Italy and there's not much that compares to Caprese that melts in your mouth upon the first bite. Authentic Italian food and especially groceries are hard to find, but Defalco's has it perfected. They even have the Caprese and mouthwatering mozzarella down! I walk in and I feel like I've entered a small market in Italy. If only they could find a way to place the Spanish Steps outside their door. :) \n\nIf you are looking for a tasty sandwich to brighten your day, Defalco's is a great choice. They offer delectable catering that competes with my Grandma's and practically any Italian dish or food item you can think of. Although it's a bit on the pricey side, it's well worth it for the quality you receive.","425681":"Love this place but giving it a 4 star as it can be somewhat slow and few healthier options to select from. Yeah I know, penalizing them for not \"healthy\" is probably silly as you know when going to let's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good. That being said the food at Defalco's is very high quality - almost as if you are in Italy and am not comparing it to fast food.\n\nI suggest you wait to try out Defalco's when not in a rush as its worth the wait. There order system is very similar to local places back east (basically avoiding technology) and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food. I am from back east (NY area) and finding a good Italian deli \/ grocery store in the Phoenix area is not an easy task. A friend introduced me to Defalco's and anytime I am headed south on Scottsdale road (which is often) and after passing Thomas my stomach seems to pick up we are near Defalco's as it starts giving me the rumble noise.\n\nI have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Parmigiana, and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot. I recommend to bring a friend and each get a different large sandwich and share.","425756":"We didn't get a chance to try the deli, but the pepperoni was delicious and made some awesome pizzas at home.  The homemade sausage was delicious, lots of fennel seed, parsley, and mozzerella.  YUM!  \n\nThey've got a great selection of canned Italian tomatoes, olive oil, pasta, olives, frozen desserts, meats and cheeses, balsamic vinegars and more!  The tomatoes (Cento) I bought were so delicious and flavorful... made a great dinner with bread, olive oil and pasta also purchased at Defalco's.\n\nI'd definitely come back... I'd love to try the deli items (anti-pasta, salads, etc) and OMG the desserts looked amazing!!!","425798":"Defalco's is the place to be for authentic and delicious Italian food.\nI tried this quaint little grocery\/deli while on vacation last year and, now that I am a permanent resident, I go as often as possible.\nI could spend all my time just admiring the imported products on their shelves and behind the counter; wine, olive oil, pastas, sauce, cured meats. But, the real treat is the food they serve. This is the best casual dining Italian restaurant you'll find in the valley. Their pastas and salads are out of this world. The sandwiches are to die for.\nI'm always down for \"Il Purista,\" a cold sub that includes prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato, roasted peppers, e.v.o.o & balsamic vinegar. The gnocchi with Alfredo sauce can't be beat, especially with a side of marinated artichoke salad. And they have an assortment of beverages to wash it all down, including beer and wine.\nJust order at the counter and they'll serve you at your table. Take-out is fantastic. Catering..highly recommended.\nSitting here, writing a review for Defalco's, is enough to make me want to head on over.\nYou should do the same..you won't regret it.","425965":"This place is lost on me. The store front is cool and has a lot of neat stuff (cookies, canned tomatoes, frozen ravioli, etc) but the food is not good. I got a meatball sub and a sausage sub. The board says homemade but to me the sausage tastes like a frozen breakfast sausage and the meatballs were not the consistency I imagined. Can't speak to the pizza or pasta.","426679":"Bomb bomb food probably the best Italian place iv been to here in the valley!! Iv had several items off the menu can't go wrong with any of them!! For sure check it out!","427622":"Third visit to Defalco's recently and still don't see what all the fuss is about. Customer service is very good and prompt but the food is menza menz based on the cheesesteaks, Italian sandwich, and tuna sandwich. Found the cheesesteak to be somewhat salty and bread dry and lacking flavor. The steak meat was top quality with very little gristle and cooked properly but the overall saltiness detracted from the experience. \nThe Italian sandwich offered better quality bread but still was lacking the punch of flavors you'd expect from a great sandwich. Very good quality meats nicely assembled but still did not meet expectations based on the reviews. I believe the tuna was a mix of the two grades of tuna and again very bland. I did see a few people eating pasta and should probably try next visit since it did appear to be fresh pasta.\nThe store itself is fairly well stocked with both frozen and dry goods as well as several selections of jar sauces and various Italian specialties and, of course, a deli. It's nice that they offer a nice selection of bottles of wine and\/or beer with your meal or for take out but overall, based on the sandwiches I tried, not the best sandwich shop in the Scottsdale area. \nA special Thank You to the staff member who brought a bowl of water for our dog while we ate outside, that's customer service!","427747":"Last night my friend came over to watch the Dexter season finale and we decided to pick up food from Defalco's. We decided to each pick something and share.  \n\nI got the cheesesteak- brilliant.\n\nHe got an egg salad sandwich- idiot.\n\nI was pissed I had to share with him.\n\nSeriously, never agree to share your cheesesteak.  It is just too good.   \n\nOn a side note, their egg salad is just fine. It's just not that good when you have all these flavors from a cheesesteak dancing around in your mouth. Also, their sandwiches are larger than my head. I have a big head, so that is saying a lot.","427923":"Defalcos is hands down one of the only down to earth family restaurant left, they always care about customer service and food quality!\n\nLove their spaghetti & margarita pizza is to die for","428138":"I really like this place , I've ate this please multiple times and has yet to disappoint. \n\nThey have fantastic Cannolis fresh and cold just how it should be . \n\nPrice is very good with a huge amount of food  quality is is worth it . \n\n\nI'll revisit again ..","429543":"I love this place! I've been here quite a few times but have only had their italilan cold cut sandwich and the philly cheese steak sandwich. Both are delish!!\n\nIf you're impatient, I recommend calling ahead and then picking up your order. Although it's worth the wait if you're in the mood to dine-in.\n\nThey have a cute little grocery area to browse while your waiting too. If you're ever in South Scottsdale, I definitely recommend this place.","429651":"Always great! & almost always very busy! \n\nThere are so many great things to choose from and I have that to look forward to.\n\nMy last few visits have been awesome once I got my order in, that's the hard part as there are 2 order stations and each one is for it's own items. First timers will be confused, as I was as the lines snake through the tiny grocery lined dining room. stick with it and focus, as the payoff is amazing\n\nIt's ultra casual for sandwiches and Italian dishes this good. Quality sliced meats and cheeses are priced well and the specialty grocery items like San Marzano tomatoes and great Italian wine abound.\n\nThis is one of those hole in the wall gems! trust me and check this place out.","429655":"If you are looking for real authentic Italian food this is the place to go! I have been eating here for the last five years and it truly the best Italian food around Arizona. I swear you won't be disappointed.","429757":"After reading all the wonderful reviews, I had very high expectations. I was completely disappointed. The customer service was horrendous. My husband was made fun of in Spanish by an employee over his France football jersey. Funny thing is my French husband is fluent in Spanish. Next time wait until your back in the kitchen to make fun of customers. Philly cheese steaks mediocre. Most of the food in the deli case was old and crusty. The place was disgusting, too many employees standing around doing nothing as well. It was actually uncomfortable to be stared at while we ate. Also noticed health code violation of storing food items directly on floor. We bought a few food items to go and a lot of cheese, my husband forgot his wallet at home and had to wait for me to pay. The manager on duty proceeded to laugh in his face. This place is a joke and we will never spend our hard earned money in this establishment again.","429793":"This is really Italian - always the freshest of ingredients used- great deli and store too\n\nA DDD stop that really is awesome!","430049":"Im on the search for the best cheesesteak. This ranks as my # 3. I will definetly be back to try some other menu items, but i will make sure i get their early cause i waited 30 min. for my food.","430756":"Actually, was a little disappointed .  We ordered the eggplant parmesan sandwich, meatball sandwich, and the Italian beef sandwich. All three sandwiches were Luke warm, and the bread wasn't crusty. We ordered them on the seeded sub roll and the \"crispy\" baguette. I'll try this again because I want to love this place.","431503":"Wow.\n\nDefalco's brings Italian food to a whole new level! Do not be deceived by their name, it is a grocery store but they have a restaurant tucked away in there as well and you do not want to miss out. Hidden behind the aisles of delicious shelf stable Italian food, as well as fresh you will find a deli, as well as a counter where you can order pizza's, pastas, calzones, sandwiches, salads, desserts, oh and the best philly cheese steak sandwich (don't question this just get it!) \n\nYou will probably have a hard time anytime of the day or week finding seating in here, it is a really small place, but if you have the patience it is not impossible to get a seat, and you do seat yourself. So if you come with someone and you notice an open table immediately send someone to sit there even if they haven't ordered yet, because chances are that when you're done ordering it will be gone.\n\nYou can also purchase wine here by the glass or the bottle, if you want some you might as well buy a bottle because the glass will run you about $7 dollar and you can find some decent ones on their shelf for around $15. Just ask for some wine glasses and for the bottle to be opened. No corkage fee either.\n\nI would choose a meal here over a fancy Italian restaurant any day. The calzones blow my mind even their simple cheese calzone is amazing. They come with marinara on the side, not inside of it. This prevents it from getting soggy. The dough is light, crisp and perfect. \n\nThe pastrami sandwich is the best I have ever had. The Philly cheese steak sandwich is also the best I have ever had. It makes it so hard to choose!\n\nThey also have these little marzipan cookie\/cakes that are so delicious for only about $1. Along with a wide array of other desserts like cannolis.\n\nSo if you are in the mood for Italian head to Defalco's everytime.","432309":"I had the combo sandwich and the pesto pasta salad, both were awesome. I can't wait to go back and sample all the other options and there were tons! Huge selection of pasta salad, sandwiches, pizza, hot pasta, and desserts. The food was worth the wait at lunch hour, but take their advise and call ahead if your in a hurry .","432952":"Sandwiches were very good.  Cross another Diners, Drive inns, dive place off the list","434089":"One of life's greatest pleasures is revenge, and I can't think of a better place to dish it up than at Defalco's.\n\nHere's how.\n\nIt's Saturday and the girls are looking for a place to lunch. Recommend Defalco's, explaining how their sandwiches are off the planet. \nWhen you get there, hang back and order last. It's a small place with nowhere to loiter once you've ordered, the girls will be forced to a table. \nNow the revenge.\nYou recommended the Italian sub to the others, saying how the portions are super small and to order the whole instead of the half. They believe you and order. \n\nOnly now, as none of them are within earshot, having wandered off to their table, you order a small cup of mixed olives, a plate of Italian cheeses, and a glass of Chianti. So very European!\nYou won't find this anywhere on the menu, but Defalco's will make it for you special, it'll cost around 10 bucks. \n\nGo take your seat with the girls and wait, as the server tries to squeeze three subs the size of Shaq's sneakers onto the table - right along side your tiny plate of cheese and olives.\n\nThey're mortified. \nStaring at their 'subs' as all the hot ASU guys in this place are now staring at them. This, as you daintily pick up an olive, a small piece of cheese and take a sip of chianti while smiling at the girls.\n\nNow enjoy, as your bitch 'friends' pay for that remark you overheard them make at Jessica's bachelorette party last weekend, the one about how your butt resembles Kim Kardashian's on steroids.\n\nHave another sip of wine sweetie.\nBeautiful, isn't it?","434625":"Best Italian food in AZ hands down. Great place to take a date or grab a bottle of vino and relax. Would recommend this place to anyone!","435979":"Why do I see dusty groceries at every \"Italian deli\"? I used to work for a very picky Sicilian man that ran a pizza restaurant and cleanliness was right next to food quality and freshness. This place has the same overpriced who knows how long they have been sitting canned stuff all the others have. And I find this not very appetizing. As for my sandwich, I would have liked a fresher loaf, the bread was dry, meat was good but ended up overly chewy and the \"sub roll\" overpowered the sandwich.","436074":"In my opinion, Defalcos has the best Italian food hands down. My family has tried other local Italian restaurants and we always end up coming back. \n\nTheir Fettuccine Alfredo is to die for. And, I disagree with a previous statement about the garlic bread. I always order extra to take home. The portions are huge, so order 1\/2 order if you don't want to take any home. Their clam chowder is also very, very good. But isn't always available. \n\nI have friends in Awatukee that drive into town on weekends specifically to eat here. \n\nThey have a great wine and beer selection, we always like to purchase 2 bottles of wine.  Drink 1 with dinner, and take the other 1 home.  \n \nCalling ahead of time is recommended, because as others have said, the wait can get pretty long due to overcrowding of the restaurant. But, if you are looking for a fun, friendly atmosphere, this is the place. They have magazines out front and newspapers, so it is fun to go and people watch while waiting for your food. And remember... the workers are true Italians, so sometimes you might catch an argument, or someone giving a customer grief. Its all part of the experience and fun.","436588":"How can you not love Deflaco's! We have been going for years and everything is so good and the service is great. I had a 1\/2 ham and swiss sandwich with a side of red potato salad and my boyfriend had 1\/2 turkey sandwich with a side of mustard potato salad. The 1\/2 sandwhichs are such a big portion so it's plenty and the sides were also pretty good servings. I love the grocery portion of store as well!","436654":"My experience is this:\n\nI heard the hype, wanted to taste the hype, could see the hype, didn't like the hype.\n\nI ordered one of the two barometer sandwiches for an Italian deli; the meatball sub. The other is the Italian cold cut which I will try.\n\nPrice was OK, size was OK, bread was VERY good, meatballs were pretty good, sauce was MEH.\n\nThe real reason for the 2 star review, trust me I am not a hater, is that it came out cold. Not like NOT-steaming hot, not luke warm but actually cold. \n\nIt was super packed and right at lunch time, just before noon so I would have expected it to be piping hot.\n\nI will try the Italian cold cut and may update this review to a more favorable one. For now, color me unimpressed.","437622":"This is by far the best deli in all of the Valley (OK, that's noy saying a WHOLE lot), and may also be the best sandwich place too.\n\nEvery single thing on this menu is great, from the caprese sandwich to the lasagna. And don't forget about the Italian sausage...delicious!\n\nPlus, the people are super-cool and the environment is friendly and comfortable.\n\nOnly two drawbacks: \n\n1) The wait, especially on the weekends. This place gets busy, and it takes them a really long time to make stuff.\n\n2) The bathroom still uses that old cloth towel rotator thing...you know, the one you have to pull down in segments? That thibg is really gross, and may not be at all sanitary. Seriously, do they just keep using the same one huge cloth the whole time? Does it get replaced, or do the just wait for it to dry and then rotate it back in? Either way, I don't see how that's a good idea.\n\nOk, sorry I spent so much time on that. For God's sake, I gave this place 5 stars you'd think I would concentrate a little more on the positive!","438270":"Oh my gosh, this place is amazing!  I went for lunch & I'm upset I only got a half!  Yes it's busy & you may have to wait a moment for your food.  However, they state that right on the door when you walk in.  I went right around 2pm & only waited about 5\/10 minutes before I was on my way home with my delicious food! Hands down amazing sandwhich (ham, turkey, & cheese) & those pickles they have are amazing!  Great prices too.. I WILL BE BACK.. maybe tomorrow?","438943":"Suuuper slow service. My dish of choice was the chicken parmigiano sandwich which lacked greatly in flavor. Given the reviews and recommendations, I'll give it a second try however my first experience alone would not have me returning.","439589":"Love this place, food is amazing!!! I've never been disappointed with their food and they are super dog friendly. And their patio is covered all day and has misters so it's never too hot.","439837":"I've been looking all over Scottsdale for real spumoni ice cream, and finally found it at Defalco's! Along with a nice selection of Italian cookies, it made my last dinner party. Have eaten here several times, and can't say enough good things about their prepared foods. Takes a while to get your food (mostly because they're always busy), but it's well worth the wait!","440354":"How are their sandwiches so so good! Literally best I've ever had. Great price, lots of real deli meat. Usually busy but worth it! I love Italian delis but this is my fav by far!","440673":"To simply put, nothing special.  We had steak and sausage combo sandwitch and margarita pizza.  They were both bland and terribly uninteresting.  Based on what we had, I don't know how they are rated 4 stars in Yelp.","440996":"Great family owned restaurant, it's hard to find anything here that's not amazing, from their hard to find Italian items in their grocery to the amazing sandwiches and pizza!","441223":"Called at 11:15 to confirm they had dough balls for home made pizza, as it's a drive to get there. \"sure we have plenty\" ... Do I need to do anything else to make sure it's available? \"no\"... arrive an hour later, sorry sold out. Didn't even try to make it right.\nBeen a great place for many years, but start crapping on your customers like that and it will impact your business. I won't be back.","441421":"If you want Italian, it's as good as it gets, this is the place to visit.  Whether it's for the grocery aspect or the restaurant, it is delicious!!  \n\nPizza is amaze-balls!!!!!","441810":"I was referred to this place from a friend. It's so close to us. I LOVE this place. I love they sell fresh made meats and cheeses. There pizza is the best! Their calzones are amazing and HUGE! It's our new favorite Italian place now!","441882":"Generally tasty food, nice atmosphere, cool grocery store\/products, very very tasty cannoli. We drive from Gilbert to visit.","441925":"Perhaps the reason for my three-star review is my expectations of this triple D eatery were a little bit too high.\n\nMy wife and I stopped in for a \"quick \" lunch on our way to run a few errands. The meal was nothing but quick, after waiting online for about half an hour to place my order, we waited for a good 40 minutes before being brought half of our ordered meal. Ice cold.  \n\nAfter sending it back and getting a quick apology, my wife's calzone came out. The calzone was about what you would expect - ton of cheese, pepperoni, dough cooked perfectly. It was actually quite delicious. \n\nThen, my sandwich which was featured on diners drive-ins and dives return. While it was praised in several of the reviews on here and on TV as gods gift to earth, I felt like it was nothing really that special. A little bit too much bread and the homemade sausage while flavorful was not all that unique and mild in seasoning (I ordered the hot sausage). The food was probably four stars in quality I just had higher expectations after all the reviews and TV segments and word of mouth.\n\nWith respect to the interior, the place is crowded. But cute queens and features and Italian markets that carries specialty items that look quite interesting. Personally, not a huge fan of people looking over your shoulder to view items while you eat but to each his own.\n\nIf I return, it will be for a planed to take out order or to go order. The bakery and antipasto looked really appealing. As far as for a sub sandwich or pizza - I'm more likely to get something closer to home with an abundance of high-quality pizza in Phoenix Arizona.\n\nOverall, it was pretty damn good. But just not that good.","443018":"They make everything to order and the ingredients are fresh, but I don't know if the food was sitting out for a while or if they don't cook it piping-hot, because most of the meal came out lukewarm.  The Italian beef with provolone was just ok, nothing special - maybe a tad better than the version served at Portillo's.  The Centurion calzone was tasty - I liked the mix of ingredients (mozzarella, roasted peppers, Kalamata olives, sopressata, basil, and tomato), but again, I wish that it came out a little hotter, with the cheese a little more melted.  The calzone is pretty large, and the leftovers tasted better heated up the next day.\n\nThere are about 15 or so tables that fit 2-3 people each, and a line quickly forms during peak lunch hours.  It's hard for groups bigger than 3 people to really sit together, because most of the tables are small and seat only two.  You're also basically sitting and eating among grocery shelves.  \n\nI'd say that the marinara sauce was the best component of the meal, even though it (along with the sausages) also came out lukewarm.  But overall the food was not memorable or worth the drive.  And since I can buy San Marzano tomatoes at more and more places now, I don't think I will be coming back here.","443985":"This place is charming. The food is top notch. The service is great. Anthony is friendly, it was nice to meet the creator of many of the recipes. I always buy my favorite wine here. The deli is also great!  I am waiting with an orange blossom by Papago brewery for my artichoke veggie lasagna!  Can't wait to try it!  Do come here! The mornings are chill.","444427":"Upon visiting Defalco's I had their chicken parmigiana sandwich and my friend had their chicken pesto. The food was very mediocre, just very bland. The tomato sauce for my parm tasted like it came right out my of school cafeteria from when I was in grade school. I went at a time when there were very few customers (about 7:30pm) and the wait was a little ridiculous, about 25 minutes. \n\nHowever, the bad aside, there were some things I liked a lot about this place. One was the layout, its a bit confusing but kinda fun. The tables are kinda strewed out through the store and its kinda cool eating among the various grocery products. Two, they had an excellent bottled beer selection with a very wide variety. Three they had an excellent happy hour special, 3 dollar imports, 2 dollar domestics.","444974":"Was across the street getting my tire fixed and saw this place. Being a sucker for Italian delis, I decided to head over and see what they had. The menu is pretty decent sized to the point where I wasn't sure what I was going to have until I was at the front of the line. They also appear to be doing a pretty hopping business judging by the line at both the bakery and the hot food section. I ended up ordering the \"Hot beef in juices\" which is basically an Italian beef sandwich minus peppers and onions. It was pretty good though I wasn't in love with the roll it was on, but otherwise no complaints. I plan on going back and exploring the menu more since there is a ton of items on it that I'd love to try.","445348":"An awesome little Italina deli, I would recommend the Il Purista sandwhich. . the prosciuto is so good! This is not a fast place so don't expect your order to come flying out at you but its worth the wait in my opinion. \n\nAlso has a good little selection of olive oils, olives, breads, and other goods available","445430":"Hot Giardinara Pepper is a must! I always stop by DeFalco for these peppers. They are home-made and delicious. The menu at DeFalco have variety of delicious food and it often took me a while to make a decision on what I should order. It is because I don't want to miss any delicious options offered on that day. My all time favorite is eggplant parmigiana sandwich. The lightly fired eggplant is so tasty and juicy.","445461":"I am still scratching my head, wondering why Guy Fieri liked this place so much. It was clean, the food was good, but so is Subway...sorry.","448413":"I stopped here yesterday after arriving after traveling all day from the East Coast. Needless to say after airplane snacks I was starving. \n\nMy wife and I have a tradition of going to at least one Diners Drive ins and Dives location in every new city we travel to.  \n\nWe ordered an Il Purista sandwich on whole wheat roll to take back to the hotel.  While waiting for the sandwich to be done we perused the groceries and wines they have in the store. They have everything imaginable for a great Italian meal from antipasto to dessert. We ended up buying some fig cookies to nosh on as well. \n\nWhen arriving at the hotel we dug in. The sandwich was prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato, roasted peppers, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The wheat roll was soft and worked well with the sandwich. Total cost for the sandwich, two drinks and cookies was about $25. \n\nThe best compliment I can give this place is that it reminds me of Italians Delis back in Hoboken.:)\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Scottsdale.","448778":"Defalco's will always have a special place in my heart. This one of a kind Italian deli nestled on the border or Scottsdale and Tempe has served me at least 15 lbs of prosciutto over the last few years. I go here for one reason only, the Il Purista sandwich. It's basically 1 while inch of prosciutto and fairy dust on a French baguette. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving Defalco's four stars is because the service is pretty rough. When I'm having an amazing day and feel on top of the world, I come to defalco's because I know they can even me out with their stern personalities, long wait times for takeout, and overall lack of smiling\/positivity. Though I enter their doors and soon lose self esteem, I continue to come back time and time again to be reunited with their prosciutto and phenomenal ingredients. \n\nPro tip - leave your personality at the door but bring your tastebuds and second stoma \n\n\nUpdate !!!\n\nThe owner, Anthony, messaged me personally about having better service and thanks for the feedback. Awesome awesome service and personability.","449383":"We ordered the 10 inch centurion canzone and split it!  So yummy.  We saw Guy Fierro on food channel and wanted to try this!  Mind blowing good","449798":"Exactly what you would wish. A small italian market with incredible food. I've had half the menu and never a bad thing. If you want a sub bypass all the sub shops and go there. Eggplant parm is awesome.","449850":"Best cheese steak sub ever!!! It does take some time to get your food, but the wait is definitely worth it!","450676":"Chicken pesto pasta and steak sandwich are my favorites! This place is authentic Italian, it doesnt get much better than this in the valley. Order well ahead of time if you are wanting take-out. Grab a jar of hot giardiniera while you are there, and throw some in to your home recipes for a real kick!","450692":"I'll make it simple.  Come for the food, and stay to shop.  Or, come here to shop, and stay for the food!  Either way, you cannot go wrong!\n\nTheir home made Italian sausage sandwich is $6.85 and deliecious; while their equally yummy Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is $7.50. Both are great!  \n\nBut if you come, stay & shop in their imported Italian foods section. Their meats & cold cuts are outstanding!!! Try the Capicolla at the deli counter.  It costs only $8.00 for a pound and is much better than the Boars Head brand.  They also have a decent wine selection of Barolos and Chiantis, though a bit pricier than Total Wine or BevMov.\n\nWe came here to pickup some Italian delicacies recently and stayed for lunch and glad we did!\n\nEnjoy!","451249":"Defalco's is good, delicious, Italian fun. I've been on their meatball subs, with everything homemade and loaded with cheese, for some time now. They've got my order just a bit off once or twice (bringing out an entire, large caprese instead of the small side salad) but everything is so delicious and fresh and the place is so fun, you won't care. Plus, caprese!\n\nIt's also a great source for hard-to-find Italian ingredients, like ladyfingers for my friend Lorenzo's famous tiramisu. They had just the right kind and for a decent price. Add delicious cannolis, fast service, and a huge menu, and you've got a recipe for awesome.","452420":"Defalco's is the go to Italian place in Dcottsdale for me.  Made to order Alfredo, great wines, and a really cool Italian Grocery.  Please visit these guys, usually busy during lunch but not so much on the weekend or evenings.","453512":"Great Deli! Our first time visiting on our vacation in May. We will definitely come back.   We shared  an antipasto salad to go and it was really good, Nice and fresh and lots of meat\/cheese\/olives etc.  Can't wait to try their other options on our next visit.","454401":"Being from the East coast and lived in Scottsdale for over a year, This is deffinatley the place to go for deli in an Italian way. Now that they even have Pizza I continue to be impressed. Although at times Especially lunch their may be a wait but the way I see it is if there is one, it is for sure waiting for, but I prefer to call ahead my order so I am in and out or be able to sit down and catch up on a few games on one of their flat screens. Since I have been going here, the place has continued to grow into greatness. The cured meats, Fresh olives and the array of Pasta and cold Salads are sensational. Did I mention the wine selection. I am not so up on wines but the owner Tony is more than happy to help me or my friends out. I also like to use this place on anything Italian I may cook because not only is it good for Deli they have a market of Italian items to cook with. Clean Deli, Clean Bathrooms, old school Ambiance, Fresh Fresh Fresh and the sillyness of the staff make it a fun experience. This alone and the fact no other deli compares, I give them 5 outta five stars.. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! Keep it up!!! and Ill keep coming back!!","454716":"I just moved to Phoenix and have only lived on the West Coast for a few years now, but I am Italian, born and raised in Brooklyn, NY to a family in the Italian bakery business in Greenwich Village for 30+ years, so I know what real, authentic Italian food and hero's are supposed to taste like. I know good food in general, and Defalco's blew my mind. \n\nI ordered 1\/2 of eggplant parm hero and 1\/2 of a portobello mushroom hero, and it was the closest thing to NY food I had had in years from Florida to Los Angles. I thought I was back in Brooklyn. It was out of this world good. \n\nMy husband is a native of New Jersey, and he was stunned to see Taylor ham on the menu as that is a traditional NJ classic, and only people from that area would know of such a sandwich. \n\nHe ordered 1\/2 of Cheesesteak hero and a 1\/2 of Chicken cutlet parm hero, and though the Chicken cutlet hero was amazing, not one piece of fat and cooked to perfection, that Philly cheesesteak brought him back to his childhood at the Jersey Shore and was reminiscent of Pat's Pizza in Point Pleasant. He said it is the best he has tasted since moving out of NJ. \n\nWe just can't believe this family is not from Brooklyn because the food is as close to Brooklyn and East Coast as you will ever taste in this part of the country. \n\nWe were impressed and nostalgic after eating there today, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a taste of NY as you have always remembered it to be. \n\nSimply amazing!","454778":"DeFalco's is a favorite that stands the rest of time. I have the opportunity to enjoy great Italian food from them as long as I can remember. From back when they were on Thomas road , my sons grew up on their meatball subs. \nNow they enjoy the pizzas and pasta choices(lots to choose from or customized)\nWith the great selection in their market it is like stepping through the doors into Italy itself.","454940":"*Im so excited! And I just can't hide it, Im about to lose control and I think I like it!!!*\n\nThis was the song I was singing as we were walking into this place to have dinner! I was honestly super duper excited to try this place after I read all of my fellow yelper's reviews! This place is odd but in a cool way, it's a grocery store and a small restaurant. The store offers a variety of Italian food\/ingredients along with random tables set around the store, so if you choose to stay and eat you can literally have a seat anywhere.\n\nI was looking forward to a known Italian dish, the chicken parmesan and my friend ordered the baked ziti. It does take a little while for your food to come out, but because this was my first time here I had no problem looking around through the store and enjoying observing people (I like to people watch) as we waited. We ordered the meals so we received our main dish along with salad and Italian bread. The salad was small, basic and simple nothing really exciting there; the Italian bread was crispy and had a lot of flavor to it, for they seasoned it well. Now unfortunately when it came to my dish of chicken parmesan I was quite disappointed! The chicken was super dry and the sauce was really watery! Because of the sauce being so watery the whole meal lost A TON of flavor. When you have thick marinara sauce that covers the pasta and the chicken you get an abundance of flavor from the sauce, spices, chicken and noodles. I was really hoping for some authentic mouth watering chicken parm and my tummy was sad to get....... a mediocre dish. When I tasted it I immediately thought.... we should have gone to Olive Garden for their chicken parm! Now on the other hand I was able to have a few bites of my friend's baked ziti and that was to die for! The noodles were cooked perfectly, the sauce, the meat, the spices, the cheese.... mmmmmmm everything in the baked ziti was delicious! So many flavors, so thick and creamy, I wanted to trade my chicken parm in for an order of baked ziti!\n\nI have mixed feelings about this place from not liking my meal to enjoying my friend's meal! I may go back and try other things on their menu just to give it another whirl, but I will be going somewhere else when I am on a chicken parm kick!","456735":"Steered away from the Italian food and went with the Boars Head Turkey and Provolone on a Seeded Roll. It was a foot long and only $6.95. Great value and good ingredients. This though is about the Boars Head turkey. Everything else can be found anywhere and I don't think they are baking the bread, but it is good lunch value. The macaroni salad side for 2 bucks had too much mayo and not enough veggies. Always a nice staff. Back to the Italian food next time.","457358":"Unbelievably Great! You can enjoy the smells from the time you pull up! Mmmmmmm!\nGreat old school charm, wonderful food!","457380":"Their sandwiches are top notched their food is on my top 10 favorite places to eat staff is quiet but im sure they have to do some major multi tasking . they have tables inside and outside patio they get a huge lunch rush which makes it hard to find a table but seriously there's some good food there I give it I give it a AAA+++","457805":"Excellent food, nice staff, great grocery items. Eat a sandwich, a side salad, and a cannoli, and take home some bread and meat!! Yummy! I recommend the sourdough bread and the side pasta salad in particular...","458328":"The Il Purista is onto of my favorite sandwiches in town.  Tons of mozzarella, a half inch thick pile of prosciutto and basil make for the quintessential Italian sandwich.  There are so many good things about De Falcos, if you care about food, you must go.","458741":"I cannot honestly say I've had a better cheese steak anywhere else. Defalco's is absolutely the best I've had. If you know of a better one I beg you to share that knowledge. \n\nI always try and call ahead, they get really busy, often, understandably so.","459254":"We had the Centurion Calzone and the Beef Cheesesteak and they were so delicious.  Both were so flavorful and left us wanting more!  Will definitely be back if in the area.","459497":"If you're in the Tempe\/Scottsdale area looking for good east coast style Italian food, this is the place. Hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, pizza, or pasta they have it all. Enjoyed it very much!","459608":"Defalco's is probably the biggest reason we were sad to leave Paradise Valley. We loved the family, the food, the grocery....everything and after 15 years, miss it like crazy. My husband is returning for his 50th reunion and this will be the first place he visits!!!!!!!!!! Geesh, I can taste that incredible food!!!!! How we miss you!","459972":"this is by far my favorite lunch spot in the valley. The fact that it also is a grocery store only adds to its charm. All the ingredients are fresh and the servings are big. I reccomend the itialian sausage and there cold chicken pasta is wonderful. Highly reccomended for anyone who wants a nice little lunch spot. be warned though, wait times can be very long. If your willing to wait though this is a great spot.","461385":"Everyone has their own idea of how pasta sauce should taste, unfortunately D'Falcos isn't the best in my opinion. I like my mom's much more especially with her Sicilian upbringing I might be asking too much. But their eggplant is awesome it makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it. What I also feel needs improvement is I wish they were open a bit later. For Italian food than is adequate as a dinner entre being open later than 8pm on weeknights would be appreciated but then again im just one person. I do like that they are very similar to the new york city delis and that is something I definitely dig.","461765":"We decided to try Defalco's after seeing it on DDD. \nThe grocery store is stocked with lots of Italian goodies (pasta, sauce, cookies, olives, etc...)\n\nWe ordered: \n\n1. Il Purista (5 stars):  VERY flavorful and packed with lots of yummy prosciutto!\n\n2. Calzone (4.5 stars):  Pepperoni and spinach.  Takes a long time but well worth the wait if you like lots of \"bread\". \n\n3. Pizza (4 stars): 1\/2 Margarita and 1\/2 Mushroom.  There is no fresh basil on the margarita pizza...disappointing :(\n\nOverall, the food was good and we love the hole in the wall joints so we'll be back the next time we are in Scottsdale!","462485":"My name is Anthony De Falco.  I checked this place out while I was visiting my dad in AZ.  As a resident of the tri-state NYC area, I can say with unwavering and steadfast confidence that this is without a doubt the worst deli I have ever been to in my entire life.  The level of apathy and cognitive dissonance in this place was astounding.  I ordered- Chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, oil and vinegar and I essentially received a Subway quality chicken tender sandwich with some shredded mozzarella cheese covered in marinara, on the stalest bread to ever curse this earth.  How people can possibly rate this place at 4 1\/2 stars blows my mind.  I could literally go to the worst restaurant in Yonkers, NY and get a superior sandwich. You people make me ashamed to share the name. I think I will be legally changing my last name to Lindquist just so I can avoid any potential association with this abomination.\n\nEmbarrassing","462759":"Good food but not worth the wait. Took over 40 minutes to get a sandwich. If you are hungry don't expect to get your food anytime soon","463022":"imported groceries, fresh caprese salads, salami and cheese as far as the eye can see, fresh baked pizza, half orders of spaghetti with clam sauce. Need I say more?","463101":"DeFalco's has been slowly perfecting their pizza recipe for the last couple of years, and I can now say that their crust is one of my favorites in the Valley. I highly recommend trying one of their pizzas with the sweet Italian sausage. Heavenly.","463140":"A local food establishment that make a wide variety of Italian sausages by hand and they also make their own spaghetti sauce - everything is made to order, from what I can tell, so if you order food to eat there also order a glass of wine - they have a number of red and white options and find yourself sliding into the Italian frame of mind while you wait for your food to be prepared. In addition, I almost always get an order of hot Italian sausage so I can make my own spaghetti sauce at home. Along with the sausages you can get canned tomatoes from Italy and any number of delicacies from the land of pizza and pasta. I must like this place because I have a strong urge to stop in every time I'm in the area. A wonderful little bastion of Italian food culture.","463780":"This is our go to Italian spot! Everything is so good! We usually have a wait due to the amount of people that come in. But it's honestly worth it. You go up to the counter and order your food and then they bring it to your table. Everything is so good! My favorites are the chicken parm, pasta salad, and Italian beef!!! If you can TRY THE DESSERTS!!! The limoncello cake, cannolis and macaroons are Out of this world!!!!","464836":"Solid Italian deli in Phoenix.  Not the best (could use more variety and service and goods) - the best is Bayside in Santa Monica, CA - but it's worthy addition to the Italian deli pantheon.  I had the Italian sandwich.  It was good, not great.","465382":"I know I'm going to get slack for rating it 3 out of 5 stars, but I have my reasons. \n\nCame here on the 28th of July, cause we saw a rerun on the Food Networks' DDD. So had to try it out. It's in a decent location and could use an expansion. For just buying something to-go, it's great. If your going to dine in, it's a bit of a nightmare. The layout of this location is way to cluttered, they have one of the main doors locked to fit a shelf with products. Then you have all the traffic by the fountain drinks and not so good working soda machines' ice maker. The ice was getting stuck and you had people banging it to get the ice.\n\nNow! On to the food. We ordered a couple of calzones which were very good and alot bigger than we thought. The Gnocchi with Red Sauce is also very good. The pizza my daughters ordered wasn't that great, looked very unappetizing and very greasy. I honestly don't think there was any sauce on that pizza.\n\nThis is for the owners! If your going to complain (as this shorter gentlemen was doing outside) about the extra traffic your getting from being featured on DDD, than don't do it. You should be happy you were on TV.","465443":"This place is classic. Love the vibe of walking in a classic Italian deli and eating at small tables among the shelves of items for sale.  While we only had a fraction of what's on the menu, what we had was good and I look forward to going back.","465474":"This place is everything it's cracked up to be. Honestly. I haven't had a bad thing here yet. Today I got the prosciutto with mozzarella and basil. I was expecting to get a few little slices of prosciutto like most places. This sandwich is amazing. Tons of prosciutto and the mozzarella and basil are so fresh!!! \n\nSo many things left on the menu to try but I have a feeling I'll be getting this one again and again. \n\nPs-- yes they are slow. Get over it. This isn't McDonald's!","466407":"Defalco's Italian Grocery\n2334 N Scottsdale Rd\nScottsdale, AZ 85257\n\nDefalco's reminds me of many Italian deli's in New York. Racks of Italian foods that are often hard to find, and a long line to get waited on.\n\nThe sandwiches are food of the Gods. Well stuffed with premium ingredients, some are so big that they consist of more food than many third world countries eat in a month! Their hot sandwiches evoke wonderful memories of sandwiches eaten many years ago in New York, and the wonderful aromas made my stomach rumble in anticipation of the food it was soon to receive.\n\nIf you find that a sandwich is too much to eat, you can get a half sandwich for a few dollars less. Several selections on the menu are vegetarian, including an excellent eggplant parmigiana and an outstanding grilled portobello mushroom sandwich with goat cheese.\n\nFor those from back east, they serve a terrific sausage, pepper and onion sandwich which will bring back memories of places long gone. They also have sausage and meatball sandwiches that i was hard pressed to try and finish. However, leave room for dessert. Traditional Cannelloni,  Cheesecake, Tiramisu, Napoleons - all wonderful. Of course, its even better with a cup of cappuccino or espresso or a latte to help wash it all down.\n\nLest I forget, they also have a selection of calzones as well as pizza's and pasta's.\n\nThey stock a wonderful assortment of Italian food stuffs ranging from olive oils to boxed pastas along with an excellent wine section. In addition, Defalco's produces some of it's own pastas as well as it's own homemade sausages.\n\nWhile there is not an abundance of tables, you can eat on the premises if you wish. Defalco's is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. so you can eat lunch or dinner there. Be prepared for portions that are large - in fact many of them could easily be split between 2 people.\n\nTo be honest, nothing about Defalco's is cheap, but then again, you are getting premium ingredients in large quantities for that premium price.\n\nOther than it is hard to find parking and the sometimes a long line one has to wait in to get service I can't really find anything to complain about. Good food, good service worth waiting for, and good attitudes all add up to a solid 4 star rating.","467522":"Yummmm! \n\nNot a huge fan of their pasta dishes but they have tasty sandwiches. The inside is decorated with a cute little Italian grocery store with some great wines! Inside is kind of small but I always get Togo. \n\nTip: Call ahead, usually takes about 15-20 minutes to have your order ready.","467839":"So my friend that lives nearby recommended this place. She told me that it's known for Italian food & its deli. When you go inside, there is an assortment of wine, deli meat, and even sauce you can purchase! \n\nI've been on two occasions. The first time I got a Philly cheesesteak & a side of fettuccine alfredo. They were both okay, the Philly cheesesteak was probably better than the pasta. The second time I got take-out pizza & it was decent. Overall it was a very good experience & that's why I gave them 4 stars.","468494":"Ate here for the first time today, my husband has eaten here multiple times before and has always loved it. I was not disappointed. We didn't order anything fancy, just some sandwiches and a side of macaroni & cheese for our daughter (we ordered a side because they don't have a kids menu.) The sandwiches were great, just the right amount of meat and the bread they make there was delicious. But, the macaroni & cheese, someone must have sold their soul to the devil for that recipe. It was so good. Even our four year old said it was 'really, really, really good.' It lucked out for us that the side was a full bowl because when she was done with it, my husband and I got to finish it off. We will be going back.","468647":"I love this place. The crew is fun to chat with and pick on just a little. The foods are wonderful, and how can you not love a place with a case of beautiful, delicious meats?","469105":"After my review I was contacted by the management apologizing for my experience and requesting more detail to address the issue or at least look into it. That is really nice and was prompt from my post. They do care and the food is great. For these reasons I updated my stars from 2 to 4.","469223":"So glad to have found a real Italian deli in the Phoenix area that I drove 30 miles one way to shop there.\nI visited on a Saturday when I had nothing to do other seeking some decent quality Ricotta cheese and Amoretti cookies.  \nWhat a charming place. My only regret is in not arriving hungry since I'd really like to try to their sausage sandwich.  I don't eat Italian outside of the home very often since I'm usually more pleased with what I cook, but in this case, I'd really like to try their food.  I overheard two people dining and one said to the other \"I can't wait for you to try that sausage to hear what you think of it.\"  Clearly, based on reviews, seeing what diners were eating and overhearing comments, their Italian sausage must be loved by many. \nI bought the Ricotta, cookies and an interesting bottle of Pinot Grigio.  I'm not sure if it was all priced fairly,  but I was just pleased to see the selections of Cento brands, interesting Italian wines and San Marzano tomatoes!","470019":"tastes good and good size portions. recommend ordering ahead for lunch cause it gets pretty busy. i normally like to eat my lunch right after it's made but didn't get to do so the other day. came to pick up my lunch half an hour after they said it was ready but it still tasted great, not soggy at all.","471374":"Food Is above average for Arizona Italian food. Price isn't bad and decent value. The wait is the problem...I order food and it takes forever...I order to pickup and they are 30 min past the time they suggest...I tell them two hours in advance I am coming at 6pm and it's not ready to 620....come on....","471909":"Good food especially the hot food like the meatball or sausage sandwiches.\n\nIf you order a cold sub get a side of Italian dressing, the 1\/8 of a teaspoon they put on makes for a very dry sandwich!\n\nThe place is very busy for lunch on the weekdays, and service is very slow, 45 mins for us to get two subs. 20 mins. standing waiting for a table.\n\n\n*Updated with response from owner* Changed to 5 stars, Thank You\n\nS.B.\n\nThank you for your review of DeFalco's.  I want to apologize about the wait time.  We have been very busy, so it does tend to take a bit longer than I would like for food to be prepared.  As a way to avoid some of the wait, you can call your order in ahead.....  We can have your order ready for you when you arrive, and we can also have that order made to dine-in if you like.  Just an idea.....  Also, in regards to the Italian dressing, we will put as much dressing on the sandwich as you desire.  I don't have any thoughts of rationing the dressing out.  We tend to prefer NOT TOO MUCH dressing on the sandwiches, as opposed to OVER-SATURATION.  The methodology behind this, is that we can't take the dressing off the sandwich, once it has been put on.  If someone doesn't want all that dressing then we would need to remake the entire sandwich.  We are more than happy to offer you extra-dressing if you ask us to put it on.  Also we will give you as many extra sides of dressing as you desire, free of charge.  I just thought it was important for you to understand why we do what we do.\n\nI appreciate the review and I appreciate your coming to DeFalco's.  I consider all reviews to be on of my best ways of understanding what my customers want.  You have been quite helpful in this regard.  \n\nI hope you have a wonderful day, and thank you again for taking the time to let us know how you feel.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\nAnthony DeFalco-","472703":"Call it in a head of time. There's always a line and its not fast service by any means. Inside is kind of cramped and outside seating is very limited. Customer service is not where they excel, but I've gotten over it. Getting in and out of the parking lot is always entertaining but well worth all the hassle. \n\nThey have a lot of different pasta salads in their deli case that you can get by the pound, perfect to go along with your sandwich and so far all that I've tried have been delicious.","472953":"This year we decided to have an Italian dinner for Christmas with the family instead of the usual ham, prime rib etc... For me italian food is always a good choice. We went ot Defalco's for italian sausage. I got the sweet and hot italian sausages but i tried something I never had from there, it was the sausage with garlic and cheese. YUM this stuff is delicious and I will be getting it often. I grilled it which is wierd cause I usually cook it up in a pan with olive oil and peppers & onions but this stuff was so good it did not need all that.  I have been going here for years and everything is delicious. The sandwiches are great, pizza is good, and they sell wine. I love this place. If you go for lunch be prepaird they get busy.","473273":"Service is poor. With a group of 5 and order comes out inconsistently so we are in shifts. Person bringing food very rude. Chicken parm was dry and over cooked. Tiramisu was frozen. Did not measure up to expectations and certainly did not live up to the billing received on the Food Channel.","474182":"Aside from the wait to order and the other wait to get your food, Defalco's rocks!  I was there for a late lunch on Friday and I opted to forgo my usual salad choice and go for the eggplant parm sandwich - yum!  Each bite of perfectly crusted eggplant had the most amazing tangy tomato sauce and melted cheese and it was oh so dlvine!  I had it on wheat bread and finished my entire sandwich (and yes, I ordered a full size!)  What a treat! \n\n Don't try to special order at Defalco's - Jared attempted to create his own sandwich and what he ended up with was nothing close to what he ordered.  \n\nI can't wait to go back to 'make my own pizza' - i know about that thanks to Max A!  I have a feeling that I'll be visiting Defalco's quite a bit since I'm now living in the area after a recent move.  It's a good thing - well, it's a tasty thing, maybe not so good for the waistline!","474721":"I have drove past this place for years and always wondered if it was great. We are from New York and KNOW good Italian food. Today, I was watching Drive In, Diners and Dives and saw Guy ranting over what a great Calzone they make, needless to say we headed there for dinner. \n\nI ordered the white pizza and a calzone...and this was a PEPSI establishment, I know that doesn't mean much to some but it does to others. Anyway, the pizza  was thin and crunchy which I like, and garnished pretty with lots of basil. The basil is what saved this pizza because it barely had any ricotta and not much flavor. I literally had 2 slices, my boyfriend had one, and we took the rest home, this is not usual. My boyfriend ordered a calzone, when it came out the bottom was completely burned, enough that scraping off the bottom wasn't enough because you can taste it through eat bite. I took his plate with the calzone upside down to the counter and asked if this looked burned to the guy at the counter who more or less shrugged his shoulders and asked us if we wanted them make another one. I just got our money back. \n\nI was not impressed, and would not recommend this place. There are other places in the valley with much better Italian food.","475254":"I don't really understand how anyone can rate this place lower than a 4. The food is amazing. I have tried multiple sandwiches and pastas, and the pizza is ridiculous. The people working are usually in a good mood and have a short conversation with me if they are not overly busy. I usually call ahead for pick up and its always a smooth process.\n\nExtra info: The have Pepsi Products for fountain drinks and they have a fridge with a variety of drinks including Snapple, which is also amazing. Lastly, the cannolis are my favorite.","476010":"Below is my original \"review\" - I had to say something about this place at the time even though I hadn't technically been there. Well, I've been there numerous times now. I'm in love. Here's my actual review followed by my original comments...\n\nFuck you Grand Orange, you pompous twat. Mama Mia's? I love you, but you've cocked up my order one too many times.  I realize that I can get a cheese steak that's nearly as tasty (but not nearly as healthy I'm sure) delivered from Philadelphia Sandwich company. I'm also aware that I can get one that's also rather tasty delivered from Mama Mia's... however, I think it's totally worth driving a mile or two to pick it up. \n\nAnd it's not just a cheese steak - they have amazing pasta - had a fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was outstanding. Their cold subs are also fantastic. Dill pickles as well - they don't skimp. Their pasta salads are delicious as well (except I don't like peas - bleh). \n\nWine selection seems to be pretty good. In terms of varietals, they have a good range... the owner seems to be quite smart about his wines as well. Very nice staff anyway... except for my phone call tonight. \n\nMy only complaints would be that it takes a long time to get your food... not really such a bad thing I guess... but if you're on a time constraint - lunch hour or something - it'll be tight... call ahead. Prices aren't fantastic on some items either... although prices on many items are very reasonable. This is the sort of wonderful place that gives Scottsdale character and charm and contributes to it being one of the most \"livable cities\" in the US (or whatever the tag line is). Anyway, it helps one forget the douche flood.\n_____________________________________\n\nI ate a cheesesteak based on Randy's review and I enjoyed it. The meat is better quality, but for some reason I prefer the philly sandwich company... just slightly. I feel healthier eating Defalco's though. I am going to have to try other items here before really giving a complete review. I think 4 stars is appropriate. Can't give it 5 since I don't know it well enough. \n\nMy roommate went upon my recommendation from reading about it here and he came back raving about it. He's from chicago and has been starving for a good deli.\n\nI'll revise this review after more visits.","476091":"This place is bommmmmb!!! Definitely my favorite Italian food in the Old Town area. Try the stuffed peppers !\n\nNot your typical douchey restaurant. Very casual and they also play good music the staff is really nice as well.\n\nThey also have grocery items you can buy but I'm sure you won't make it as well as they do","476240":"If your looking for a DDD place, here's one for you. It's really good Italian food for being in AZ. If your use to east coast Italian you'll think it good but not great. I have had there pasta and sauce it good meatballs taste like over cooked meatloaf, sandwiches are good but a little dry. Staff is great and store to get quality ingredients is great. Definitely a must try to check off your DDD list.","476400":"Defalco's is a family favorite! they make handmade pizzelle cookies that are amazing! they don't make them often but when they do my wife will buy all they have.  While she was pregnant, she asked if they could call her anytime they made a batch, and they did!  This place is usually incredibly busy yet quick to take care of the customers.  So for them to take the time to give her a call and let her know about a desert was impressive.  We take friends here anytime they are in from out of town.","476646":"First off, I need to give credit to the great counterguy who made my first visit here very nice. There was a big line to order as i entered, so i decided to grab a menu and call something in, but the counterguy just took my order at the front pick-up counter instead and 15 minutes later I was out the door with my chicken parmesan dinner order valued at about 11 bucks. The small salad had alot of tomato wedges, a few purple onion rings and some romaine lettuce - nothing memorable, but the garlic bread was quite good.\n     I have a long history of eating chicken parm and it is just about my fav dish, but this wasn't a great version, in fact it was unusual to a point that it reminded me of a dinner you would get from a college pizzeria. The chicken was sliced and barely breaded and the sauce really didn't have any taste (needed oregeno or garlic or something). If your making chicken parm, you take a breast of chicken, bread it, fry it and then you serve it to me. Never has the chicken been pre-sliced before - totally not authentic. For me, it's about the crunchy breading. The pasta in the dish was good, but overall it also needed more mozzarella cheese as well.\n      Will likely return to try something else and the pizza looked good, but skip the chicken parm if you value tradition.","476913":"Went there last night after many years.  The steak and cheese is the best in Arizona \"PERIOD\".  The crispy bread was outstanding.  The Moretti beer was good and the salad selection was fresh and tasty.  The menu is large and Italian.  I bought three pounds of Italian sausage and some pasta.  Manga Manga.","476948":"This Italian Deli is fantastic!! The food is homemade, there is a great grocery section with imported wines, olive oils and pastas. I always order the tuna salad with italian dressing or the turkey and avacado sandwich on a baguette. Their eggplant parmesan is delish too. The music is always an interesting blend of electronic and jazz, and their iced tea is fresh. Whats not to love?","478077":"Be prepared for a good wait time around lunch. Interior is also pretty tiny, so don't expect to eat inside. \n\nThe cannolis are pretty much perfect.","478287":"I love this place!!!\n\nI'll admit...I haven't tried all that many things here, but that's because I always end up going because I'm craving linguine w\/white clam sauce. However, everything looks delicious! I have also tried their chicken parm., which is good.\n\nI like this place because you get good food at an affordable price. There is nothing fancy about this place; they use cheap silverware and ugly plates, but who cares? The food is great! if you order a whole pasta meal, you get garlic bread, a quality side salad, and a large-portioned entree. The garlic bread is not great, but I can live with that.\n\nI will certainly be back to try their sandwiches, prepared salads, and desserts.","478425":"Being from Chicago, I am pretty picky about my Italian food.  Defalco's may not be exactly what I am used to, but it certainly fits the bill.  Service was friendly and fun, nice selection of wines, meats and cheeses; some indoor seating for the lunch crowd and the smell in there is amazing...just like your italian grandma's kitchen when you were little!!\n\nCall ahead if you are thinking of going for lunch, this place gets jammed at lunchtime!","478583":"The meatball sub here is AMAZING! I stopped in here after seeing it on tv and went on guy fierys recommendation and it definitely did not disappoint. Highly recommend it","479094":"This place has everything I want in a deli. After living back east and in Italy, I wanted to just sit back and soak in the vibe.\n\nCounter help was very timely with our order, even asked us if we needed drinks.\n\nFood came in an appropriate amount of time for the number of customers. My sandwich was the best. Gina's spaghetti was great tasting and came with garlic bread. All very fresh and tasted like the old country. \n\nEveryone eats here, lawyers, doctors, golfers, blue collar, you name it. We all come here for the same reason, great food and atmosphere. Thanks","480404":"It doesn't get any better than this. I grew up in New York City and since I moved out to AZ in 1995, I have tried to find good Italian Restaurants and have found some good ones,but not this good. I took my parents,my wife and 2 daughters and ate there Sunday. We ordered an array of different items from the menu and we all tasted each others. Every dish was amazing. The Lasagne my wife had was the best she has had since we were in New York. I got the Caprese Salad and shared it with everyone. The Mozzarella was the freshest I have tasted in ages. I also got the \"The Centurion\" Calzone which was huge and I still have left overs. It was heaven on a plate. My elderly parents got a half of Meatball Sub and a Sausage Sub and it was amazing. I can go on and on. This is our new place to go and I live in South Chandler. I will drive there just to get their Pizza. Don't expect fancy,you order at the counter,they bring it to your table. If you want Incredible Authentic Italian food, please try it. Oh, their Cannoli's were also heaven.... I have to buy some gravy (sauce) from there which they have so many to choose from and along with their deli,so many wonderful meats and cheeses. Oh try the Cremosa Italian soda's, the flavors were sooooo good. Did I mention that I love this place!!!! :)","481504":"This place is pretty dang cool! It's right off Scottsdale Road (just before Oak). Part grocery store, part restaurant, part deli, this place has a lot to offer. I've eaten here a couple times and have enjoyed the food. They have Italian classics to sandwiches (and desserts!). So yummy!! The only criticism I have is that it is really small inside. I feel squished trying to pass through people in the aisles and the seating to eat is pretty tight too. Other than that, it's fantastico!","481842":"Some days are just golden. Everything turns out perfectly.  Usually those days dont include touring a new city, getting lost, and then randomly seeing an italian deli and saying \"oh, im hungry i'll just get a sandwich from there.\"  I didn't expect to get what I did.  I mean common, how many times do the food gods put you in the most amazing hole in the wall you ever discovered? \n\nThats defalcos. Out of a dream (and literally, too. one of the workers there is a cuuuutttieee! Hey yelp, how about YELPDating.. For the Foodies in your heart).   \n\nListen, I lived in NYC for a good amount of time and the food can compare to little italy. \n\nJust go. Trust me.","482218":"This is one of my favorite stores. I'm half Italian and come here for authentic Italian ingredients. The deli is filled with pasta dishes, antipasto, and Italian meats. There is a variety of homemade pasts in the freezer. They carry imported olive oil, cheeses, and sauces. I can find everything I need to cook a traditional Italian meal just like mama used to. There are several wines to choose from to enrich the Italian dining experience. To quote The Godfather, \"leave the gun, take the cannoli\". The cannoli here is the best I've had in a very long time.\n\nToday I picked up a bottle of garlic oil and some pasta flour. Tony was working today and we spent time talking about lasagna. He makes the lasagna here. In his enthusiasm I think he let a few family secrets slip to me, but don't worry Tony, mums the word. I can not come to Scottsdale without a trip to Defalco's.","482437":"Sorry, Defalco's - I have to take a star off for you always being so slow!  Really, every time I've been, there is a long wait - and your food is worth it, but isn't there a way for you to speed things up?\n\nThe register is old school and it always take forever to ring in an order... and then I have no clue what kind of system you use to prepare food and bring it out, but for the number of employees you have working, there's got to be a faster way?!\n\nBottom line - if you are not in a hurry, and you want some good food - go to Dafalco's!","483189":"I went there to get some true Italian sausage. I picked up some hot & mild sausage and upon seeing the dessert section I had to get a chocolate cannoli. The sausage had the true traditional Italian taste, not the chain trash that is available in the grocery store. The cannoli shell was crisp & fresh and filling was smooth light.\nEnjoy","484761":"Loved their portobello sandwich! The pizza is pretty good as well although not quite like a ny pizza :)","485023":"My mom brought me here for the first time the other day and we split the sausage\/onions\/peppers sandwich on a baguette and OMG. Amazing. We also got a side salad for $2.50 that we were able to share -- who knew a simple side salad could be so good?! Definitely will be back!","485059":"It's a decent place. Nothing unacceptable about most of the food, though the canoli I had tasted a bit stale. We picked up a meatball and half a hot roast beef sandwhich. Both were decent. I just hope this isn't the best that Phoenix has to offer.","485284":"A strange place you wouldn't necessarily know to go to. But good sandwiches. My bread was a little harder but it was made fresh in house. A co-worker had a pizza and it was great. (he shared a slice because he couldn't finish it). Two other co-workers also had sandwiches and they thought theirs were great. You can also buy fresh meats and italian goods there. Great to go to even if you are just planning an authentic Italian meal for home.","485429":"Hmmmmm... I guess we had high expectations for this place.  We arrived very early for lunch and were two of only a few others in the restaurant, but it took 25 minutes to get two sandwiches.  I am not exaggerating either.  We compared the time the food came to the time stamp on our receipt.  25 minutes.  The sub sandwich had a good flavor and lots of meat.  I liked the Italian dressing on it.  I also thought the ingredients tasted really fresh and stood out each on their own.  My husband said the flavor of the Italian beef with peppers and onions was quite flat. He said it didn't have a ton of flavor.  We also weren't too thrilled about the potato salad or the tortellini salad we got as sides either.  If we are ever in need of Italian grocery items, Defalco's will be first on the list.  Maybe we should try the pizza next time....but we'll call ahead and order it.","485853":"We were visiting Scottsdale for a week and stopped in Defalco's about 6pm  to pick up some things to take home for dinner after a long day of sightseeing.  It was our only visit to Defalco's during the trip but we'll be back during our next visit.  And if we lived in Scottsdale we'd be regular customers.\n\nFrom Yelp reviews we expected to find a great selection of Italain staples, like dried pasta and canned tomatoes, and also a great deli selection of meats and cheeses.  We found all that and also great service in a welcoming little store with a helpful man behind the counter who handed us  a menu and offered help when we said we were just in to \"drool\" and get our bearings.  We ended up with a nice fresh salad of mixed greens and other veggies, like tomatoes and carrots, with a really good Italian dressing that had a perfect red wine vinegar bite, foccaccia, and cheese and olives from the deli case.  The prices were very reasonable for all.  \n\nThe big surprise for us at Defalco's is what a good wine selection is displayed on the racks in the store of domestic and imported wines at a big range of price points from inexpensive to \"deluxe\" offering something for every kind of wine buyer.. We had fun browsing through those and picked up a wonderful Italian wine to take home at under $20..  The Leonetti  (Walla Walla WA) San Giovese whispered our name, but it's a tad outside our spending comfort zone at $70 \/ bottle...a fair price as it was marked, but not our speed on this vacation. \n\nThere was a good steady stream of what seemed to be regular customers in and out for take out as well as eat in (the pizzas coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled wonderful) which is a very good sign at the time of day we were there given folks were off work and on their way home.  Next time we'll definitely try some of the homemade Italian sausage and a calzone!","487243":"Lunch with my family! It was my dads first time there. It was amazing!!! He had the capecolli, salami, provolone sub. I had the turkey sub, mom had the sausage and pepper sub!! My kids ordered their sub with whatever they wanted in! Everything came out perfect. Went back in line to order cannolis for dessert and a pizza bianco to go!!! We will be back soon. The weather was so beautiful we got to also enjoy the outside patio which was a bonus!!","487292":"This is a cute lil Italian market on N Scottsdale Rd.  It's a lil hidden but has easy parking.  If you go there, you can pick-up some pre-made lunch and desserts from the deli section or store up on imported groceries for your house.  \n\nThere aren't many tables for eating so if you're going to have lunch and eat there, I'd suggest going a lil before or after normal lunch rush hours.\n\nI'm a fan of their lemon bar.  It's very tart and lemony!!\n\nMight see ya there!","488389":"Oh my!  We've tried Triple-D places when we travel, this little place is amazing!  Of course I had to try the Pastrami on Rye.  My wife tried their famous meatball dish.  If I'm in Arizona, I'll be visiting them again!!!  \n\nOh, bring an appetite!","488438":"Went here three times when I was based in Tempe for work.  Great atmosphere and the pizza was pretty authentic too.  They also have a great selection of Italian products (wines, olive oils etc) and their cheesecake for dessert was sinful.  Back to the pizza - crust was chewy in just the right way and not greasy.  Good flavorful pizza.  Would prefer Florencias but this was pretty good","488490":"1st off, the food is awesome. DeFalco's does not ever disappoint. \nThe fresh moz is stellar, just salty enough.\nThe sandwiches are fantastic, just like the little place around the corner from my grandma's when I was a kid...\nThe deli meat selection is perfect, they have one of my favorites, Parma Prosciutto, which is basically pork candy.\nOh yeah, and they have Molinari salami..the crack cocaine of dried and cured meat...\n\nI live in the Far East valley and routinely drive out of my way to DeFalco's. After you try it you will too.\nDefalco's is the best Italian deli in Arizona.","488802":"This place is the real deal. Just as good as the Italian delis I went to in New York. I've tried probably half the menu and never been disappointed. The Italian cheesesteak is ridiculously good, their pastas are amazing and you can find all kinds of random treats in the market. I'm also glad they got rid of the guy that was never happy at the pick up register.","488809":"The food is very good here and I enjoy frequenting here. When it comes to service there is one person who has worked there a while that seems to be very rude towards customers. I'm not going to say his name on the Internet. This place has been featured on many tv shows and has tons and tons of great menu items of all types of Italian food. Just go there, decide quickly what you want to order, pay, sit down and they bring your food out.","489220":"this was prime Italian food. I never would of known it was there if my brother had not dragged me there. the calzone was delicious as was the chicken Marsala! the cannoli was so creamy although I wish I had gotten it with a chocolate shell. I'll have to go back when I have more calories to spare","489383":"Alright so the reviews here are spot on. The sandwiches here are VERY good and I can see why this place is so busy all the time. I had both the Cheese steak and the Chicken Parm - both are excellent choices and it's hard for me to decide on a favorite. I would like to try their pasta sometime here which only means that I should come back here on another visit.\n\nThe location is a bit tricky to find at first but it's not too bad, it's right across from the China Wok right across from the parking lot. I would recommend calling ahead and ordering your food beforehand as they are quite busy during the lunch rush. As it is part grocery and part restaurant I would also recommend take out if they're busy since there's not much seating.","489872":"Try the meatballs and wine; absolute flavor - including the ambience! If you want to pay more, check out downtown Scottsdale but it may not be as fun or as reasonable. This is a neighborhood gem.","490910":"Good food for lunch.\nOur pizza took 25 min at lunch and arrived cold.  Sent back for another 10.  Was good when fresh and hot.  Grilled veggie sandwich was not done and missing the portabella.\n??????","490999":"This place is the best Italian grocery and deli I have found in Scottsdale. Not only are the sandwiches excellent, the antipasti salads are spectacular. \n\nI have also purchased some of the cured meats they sell, yum. What more could I say.","491184":"The cheesesteak is in a league of it's own. I used to work at a cheesesteak restaurant that specialized in making greasy, cheesy, melty deliciousness like any classic cheesesteak. however, the defalcos cheesesteak is more than that. the bread has a perfect crunch to it, the meat is hearty and delicious... 5 stars. not to mention the rest of their menu... all i need is that cheesesteak though","492021":"Never ordered anything I didn't like! I love family businesses and this place is awesome. I always get the stuffed shells and it's the best I've ever had!","492212":"I was told about this place by a few coworkers and I knew that I had to try it!  I used to live in Italy and I really miss the italian products and food!  It was so fun to step in there and see things I used to get in Italy!  I would definitely give the grocery part 5 stars...I go back all the time to get my italian fix.  I love their pizza it is yummy...but it took them like 45 minutes to make it.  I have also had their italian sausage sandwich which was also great but that took over a half an hour too.   I guess it is the Italian mentality where nothing should be rushed but it was a little long!  I always come back because it is delicious and so worth the wait!  The staff is friendly.  I give it four stars because the items take so long...it is ok though I will always come back and I definitely recommend it to my friends!","492968":"My go to Italian spot. Looks very unassuming from the street as it sits in a strip mall. Prices are great and it's fun to look at all the authentic Italian groceries as you wait for your food. \n\nMy favorites -- lemon bars (yes, dessert first! They're large and the best I've ever had!!), vegetable lasagna (banging w artichokes and assorted veggies), the salad with chicken and goat cheese (bomb!). Pizzas are great. Interestingly I haven't tried their sandwiches yet but I can't imagine they're anything less than great. I also like their lattes, my fav is the iced salted caramel. \n\nWhat a cool, authentic Italian grocery\/takeout\/eat-in spot. I like that they have indoor and outdoor seating too.","493201":"Defalco's Italian Grocery has the best of the best! As fresh as it gets, straight from the deli. I've been to a lot of Italian delis, bakeries, restaurants, and this by far tops my list. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. When I asked the cashier what he thought would be good, he said to me \"you can throw a dart on the board and be happy\" and he wasn't kidding. \nAfter you're done eating, pick something up from the deli to take home for dinner. Ricotta, Mozzarella, Salami, Pizza Dough, Tomato Sauce, Raviolis, you name it, they probably have it. I just wish it was closer to home, so I can go everyday.","493285":"Went back for the first time in more than 2 years.  Bottom line...just not good. Ordered two sandwiches on two different types of bread.  Bread on both was stale. Sandwich fillings were lacking ant type of flavor.  Hugely disappointing. Unlikely to return.","493350":"goddamn.\n\ndefalco's is LEGIT. nader a. was going on and on about the cheesesteak, so i had to go try one. one bite in and that's what i texted him: goddamn.\n\nstep inside and it's like you're in a whole other city. defalco's is the kind of place you'd find on a random corner in a new york or chicago neighborhood, and we're all real lucky that for some reason it exists in scottsdale of all places. it's a REAL italian grocery and deli, the kind of place that is increasingly hard to find, but when you do you appreciate the hell out of it.\n\ngetting back to that cheesesteak with everything, it was amazing, perfect in every way: the bread, the way the meat and the cheese were working together to win me over, forever. i was so impressed that the next day, new year's eve, my wife and i drove down from north phoenix so i could show her what all the fuss was about. we ordered the meatball and the portobello mushroom, so that we could each sample a variety. we also got a side order of the mozzarella basil tomato salad (swimming in balsamic) and a slice of cheesecake. \n\nthe meatball was good (i really wanna try the off-the-menu reuben) but the portobello mushroom was STELLAR, and actually complemented the meatball sandwich nicely. the mozzarella salad was tasty, but that cheesecake was the best i've ever had, and i say that with full apologies to my own mother. i understand now why they used to use \"cheesecake\" to describe the titillating bits of those old pin-up models.\n\nso yeah, great flavors, huge portions, great service, and an all around awesome place to eat.","493587":"Best deli to get any slice of meat or cheese. Even eating there is amazing. I have nothing bad to say about Defalco's but If I wouldn't get fat, I'd be here every single day","493696":"I was disappointed to find that the antipasto salad that I ordered and picked up on my lunch break didn't have any olives.  I called to let them know and the person that I spoke to thanked me for letting him know.  He offered to replace my salad on a different day.  I really appreciated the customer service recovery and I will continue to recommend them to everyone that I know!!!","494094":"Delicious food, crowded but interesting atmosphere. And they serve alcohol! Our food took awhile to come out so that's why I didn't give 5 stars.","494439":"This was my family's 1st stop of our Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food Arizona self-guided tour.  Defalco's was featured on Guy Fieri's DDD and they're an Italian food\/sandwich\/deli joint.  Why was this our first stop instead of the multitude of Food Network or Travel Channel foodie destinations located in Phoenix and Scottsdale?  Our family was here in Phoenix for my daughter's 4-day volleyball tournament and the wifey wanted her to carbo load to get her ready for some spiking and blocking.  I AM SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY DEFALCO'S WAS OUR FIRST STOP!!!!!!!!!\n\nI got a little frustrated trying to find Defalco's because we got lost trying to find it.  As we were driving down Scottsdale Road looking for the address 2334 Scottsdale Road, my GPS directed us to where it should have been, but the numbers skipped.  Just continue driving North because the numbers will resume again.  Defalco's is located on North Scottsdale Road not South.  Just make it easier to find this foodie haven because others have to try this must eat at destination.  Defalco's is an Italian market combination deli.  The seating area and overall look gives off a Mom and Pop, hole in the wall vibe, which was a great sign of what was to come.  Triple D locales usually are annointed with Guy Fieri's mug plastered somewhere in the restaurant.  There was a framed picture of him as well as a spray painted picture of his signature spiky hair and beard.  Both signifying Guy's stamp of approval of a must visit establishment.  Defalco's had shelves of Italian food products to purchase and it's a full service deli that sells delectable meats and sausages.  Interesting tidbit:  I spoke to one of the employees and asked him if his business spiked after the DDD episode.  He said it definitely opened the floodgates, but Defalco's initially rejected DDD's desire to feature them on the show.  He said they were popular already and didn't need DDD, but a customer wrote the show and was adamant about DDD featuring Defalco's.  DDD's producers were persistent and kept calling them, so Defalco's relented and man, my entire family is soooooo glad they did.\n\nI asked the kind gentleman behind the counter what Defalco's was known for and he said that they had the best cheesesteaks in the nation.  Wow, that's a bold statement and made me skeptical.  He also said their pastas, pizzas, and salads were can't misses too.  I ordered of course the half cheesesteak sandwich, small pizza with Italian sausage and pepperoni, large penne meatball pasta, and a vegetable pasta salad.  Everything is made to order, so you'll wait a little while for the food.  The wait is worth it.  I got my half cheesesteak sandwich filled with a piled amount of tender, thinly sliced rib eyed steak mixed with melted cheese and caramelized, juicy fried peppers, onions and mushrooms inside a soft bread roll. When I took my very first bite of the half sandwich that was more than enough, OMG OMG OMG, I was speechless.  As I savored this first bite, my family laughed at me because as I tried to vocalize how scrumptious this heavenly collection of meaty, cheesy, vegetably, and bready goodness, I mumbled something that wasn't discernable.  That good!!!  I didn't have to eat anything else because this sandwich alone was 10-star rating worthy.  Order a pizza.  Any pizza.  The small is good enough to feed a family of four.  The crust was tasty and had a good texture.  If I wasn't so full from my sandwich, I would have eaten more than the 3 slices I ate.  The pasta salad had good tasting dressing and the pasta had a huge, nicely seasoned meatball.  Defalco's had a good assortment of desserts.  I tried my wifey's chocolate covered cannoli and wow, I need to try more of their desserts next time.  Get the cheesesteak sandwich, you won't be disappointed.\n\nMr Fieri, I thank you for featuring Defalco's and Defalco's, I thank you for your cheesesteak sandwich.  I've been a little unlucky when it comes to my best foods ever.  Best buffet and burger in Las Vegas, best burger in Los Angeles, and now best cheesesteak in Phoenix.  6 hours to drive for a cheesesteak?  So worth it.","494540":"My boyfriend introduced me to here after moving to Scottsdale. I have seriously been missing out my entire life. My favorites are the calzone and antipasto salad. On top of it, every time I come im remembered and all the staff is so friendly and helpful. Never disappoints!","495000":"Fresh Italian grocery store - small, but amazing place.  Picked up 2 Italian Combos with peppers added - delicious!  Friendly folks! Call in order to speed through the line.","495686":"Food is great! Cheese steak is AMAZING!","496502":"They have a variety of food and desserts. I went with the Italian Combo cold sandwich and it was great! Their customer service is great, the employees are very kind, and the place is clean.","496872":"I never have a problem with the quality of the food here. If I was rating on the quality alone I would have given at least 4 stars but this place is slooooooow! I worked right down the street for years and could rarely ever eat there because I couldn't fit it in my lunch hour even when I called ahead. I don't know why everything takes so dang long but there has to be a better way of doing things. If you have plenty of time I suggest the sausage and peppers.","497242":"Oh My, Went to this place Christmas eve for a sandwich.  The parking lot was crazy full of people coming in and out, so I decided this was a great place to check out.  When I walked in, it was crazy busy.  Lots of people piled by the deli counter picking up their holiday meats and cheeses.  I just came for lunch, so I sorta cut the line and went strait to the sandwich ordering station.  It was confusing though to figure out where to go with so many people in line.  \n\nI ordered a sandwich with 3 meats on it to split with my husband. We got a monster drink and a regular soda, and some chips.  Total was pretty cheap like $12-$13 bucks.  We walked over to where the tables were to wait for our meal.  Watching all the shoppers was differently a spectacle.  Also we had time to check the place out.  It's really casual and has racks of Italian items for sale, such as hard to find wines, pasta's and freshly baked breads.  \n\nOur meal came out hand delivered in a basket, and the guy delivering was kind enough to ask me if I wanted another basket for my portion to be put in.  I thought it was really sweet of him to ask, because the place was a zoo, and just having to go past all the shoppers must have been a hassle.  But he came back with a huge smile but a minute later.\n\nI took a huge bite of the sandwich, and wow, it was really good.  You could actually tell the quality of meats and cheeses in the sandwich along with some good dressing that came dripping out of my sub sandwich.  It was a huge sandwich and I was glad I only got half, but only wished we had ordered another one for dinner.  Yes it was that good.  But I didn't want to wait in line again.  Good Stuff....Wish this place was closer to my house.","497741":"So good!! Seriously, I mean it. This place is fabulous. You will walk in and think, \"What the hell is this place?\" Then you will eat your lunch and then start planning your next meal here. Super delicious.","498019":"This reminds me of being back East. Best sandwiches I have ever eaten in this city!!!","498148":"This is the real deal. As a person of Italian decent, this is about as close to authentic home made your going to find in the Scottsdale area.  Had one of their eggplant parm subs. Nothing but excellent. Also had an order of cured Italian olives.  These are an acquired taste and are not ready available in Italian restaurants.  Not only is this a great restaurant but a great deli\/grocery. This is worth a stop.","498480":"I went to De Falco's based on a segment I saw on food network. I tried to buy some luncheon meat but had difficulty getting someone to help me. Keep in mind I went at 11:00 so as to not to bother people on a work schedule going to lunch. The selection was poor to start with, and most of the choices were boar's head brand which I can purchase less expensively at a grocery store. The counter person was rude and seemed to be bothered that he was helping me. When I inquired about Italian sausage, I was told they were out. Sorry, 11:00 in the morning and they're out of Italian sausage??? Sausage is a basic product that any Italian deli should not be out of on a work day. This has to be the worst experience I've had in a deli. I would like to have tired their lunch selection sometime, but based on how badly I was treated, I won't go back.","498522":"Reminds me of being back in New York this is the kind of deli I grew up with in the kind of food that I'm used to being Italian and being from the north east and this place is right around the corner from work so you know where I stop for lunch food is out of this world good stuff and you can find of a lot of things there that you can't find anywhere else","498865":"I personally think this is my favorite deli out in Arizona. They have a great selection of Italian meats, i go there for the soppresatta, and fresh mozzarella. The wait can sometimes be a little frustrating and a little expensive.","499164":"Love this place!\n\nThe food is awesome at very reasonable prices. Super casual spot to pick up a unique sandwich for lunch and whatever you need to make dinner that night. You're basically eating among the aisles of a small grocery shop, which is pretty awesome. Service is prompt and friendly, the food is very fresh. Can't wait to come back.","499232":"Service is SO BAD. I'm pretty sure they actually think it's ok to treat a customer like they aren't important. Food is decent. I think this place is completely over-hyped. If you want to modify any order, you're looked at like they wanna kill you. Never again.","499505":"After posting my original review, I received a message from Anthony DeFalco. Mr. DeFalco was not only courteous and objective, but seemed genuinely interested in my feedback. As a regular user of Yelp, I feel that owners who actively participate and leverage the insights gained from customer reviews to measure and improve are to be commended. That being said, I'm increasing my rating from 3 stars to 4.\n\nMr. DeFalco pointed out that they offer 4 types of bread, including a soft Italian sub roll. Unfortunately this wasn't clear to me upon my first visit.\n\nI'll stop by DeFalco's the next time I'm in Scottsdale and update my review.","500294":"Incredible sandwiches. A little pricey, but price really doesn't matter when your food is delicious.","500361":"We come here for all of our Italian grocery needs, there is no other place for it! Fresh pasta is a MUST in our house. \n\nAs for their restaurant? Wow. Delicious!! Everything we try hits the ball out of the park!!\n\nGnocchi is heavenly, meatball sub is crazy delicioso, italian sodas are creamy dreamy and the desserts? Well, make sure you save room for a food coma. The cookies are LEGIT scrumptious and the cakes (cheesecake) are perfect and creamy!\n\nThey know how to make sure flavor is bold and packed!\n\nReal Italian for real Italians too.","501463":"I've been her multiple times PRAYING that the food would knock me out and the service would at least treat you like it's important to have paying customers come in to this Overrated establishment \nWorkers all look like zombies with bad knees and hips SLOW and smug attitudes\nI stood her today for 10 minutes with no one asking if I wanted to order\nI finally caught the attention of a girl and she smuggly stayed we'll be right with you\nFogettaboutit ur dead to me we're walking somewhere else!!!","501746":"What a great sandwich! Defalco's definitely is your Italian eatery. The meat is super fresh elegantly placed in your sandwich. Everything traditional and New York style deli. So happy this place fell in my routine spots. Just a tip order a head if possible. You will wait a bit","502322":"Love their food. Egg plant permesan was awesome and pizza is great too. It's a great place to pick up food if you don't feel like cooking for dinner.","502781":"Seriously the best Italian sandwiches we've ever had. We're on vacation to Scottsdale and decided to check this place out because we saw it on DDD on Food Network. It did not disappoint! Italian Beef and Sausage Sandwich OMG amazing! We are in sandwich heaven! We also ordered a macaroon for dessert and it was to die for! We loved it all...definitely a must try!","504598":"An Italian grocery store & deli?!  I'm there!\n\nI love Sandwiches and this place delivers the goods!\n\nI like to get their whole sized Combo (Ham, Salami, Pepperoni, Mortadella & Provolone), $6.45.\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/defalcos-italian-grocery-scottsdale?select=zL2VWCvEOdu7jYX2uf4FuA#zL2VWCvEOdu7jYX2uf4FuA\nhttp:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/defalcos-italian-grocery-scottsdale?select=uNGOYSIFrzvYbY-8niWGMg#uNGOYSIFrzvYbY-8niWGMg\n\nIt's very tasty and filling, however it's not an overwhelmingly large portion.\n\nThe seating situation here can get dicey, especially around lunchtime.  There's not too many tables\/seats inside and while there are a few located on the patio outside, it can get real hot there during the Summer months.\n\nOverall, it's a great Sammie and I always look forward to dining here.\n\nReturn Factor - 87%","505319":"The Italian beef is a B+, maybe a different bread could help.\nGreat selection of all sorts of good quality food.\nThe long lines and table\/ seating situation diminishes the experience.\nIf you place quality over the wait and limited space, then this place 5 stars.","505497":"I spoke with the owner again - he's recently become aware of the reviews here. He even mentioned the one 3 star he got. They recently expanded into the store next door, so it's less crowded than it was before. They also added shelf space room for more wine. Great selection... \n\nI still love this place. I still have yet to buy pizza fixings to make a fresh pie at home, but I will.","505721":"This is a great place. It's a cute Italian market with a deli. What a gem to find in Phoenix area. The sandwiches are delicious and the atmosphere is so cute. We love this place.","506194":"I heard that this was THE PLACE to go for wonderful pizza. Well as far as I'm concerned, I had the absolute worst pie ever.  The center of the pie was not cooked the crust was soggy and limp to the point where the toppings slid off the crust. What a waste of $15.00. I will not go back EVER!!! Oh BTW, this was a take out order, I threw it out and ate a PBJ.","506290":"Defalco's is home to the best Italian food in Arizona! They have just about everything you can imagine and the casual, deli-style setting makes for easy take-out.\n\nThe food is as authentic as you can get in the Southwest. Plus, they have a nice selection of wines to pair with your meal!","506703":"Usually when I read all these great reviews, my dreams, hopes, mouth, tummy, appetite and foodgasm get crushed with disappointment. I came here for the cheesesteak. Don't call it a Philly cheesesteak like I did. The sandwich comes plain with meat and cheese, but upon request they will add grilled peppers onions and mushrooms. Just the right amount too, unlike other places that will try to use the veggies as fillers. I ordered two full sized sandwiches for my wifey and I, waited ten minutes, drove home and looked at them for a while....they didn't look anything special.\n\nFirst bite OH MAN! Kaching, Jackpot, WOOT WOOT. SIrens and Alarms went off!\nI have never been to Philly to try an OPS (kinda like OG, but stands for Original Philly Cheesesteak) and I have no desire to go to Philly either. If I ever have the urge for a great cheesesteak, good bye Corleone's and shitty US Airways Center overpriced soggy bread with morsels of imitation meat and cold hardened cheese, I will come to Defalco's. It helps having a close place by though.\n\nPS:\nYou can make two meals out of one sandwich unless your a fatzo like me or starving.\nCall ahead and just pick it up if you don't want to wait ten minutes, or plan on not eating here.\nI'm a big D man (work and live in Dallas\/live in Scottsdale), wore my Dallas Mavericks shirt and the guy wanted to charge me twice for that.\nThe line for ordering is in the back, don't stand around for five minutes at the front line where people order coffee and other hot beverages.","507067":"Busy place during lunch hours.  It was a great atmosphere, the food was delicious and well prepared.  The staff was busy but remained courteous.","507241":"This Scottsdale institution is epic in every way. Great food, great deli, and great service. If you are in a hurry, the food can take a little while during the lunch rush, so take advantage of calling ahead of ordering so it will be ready when you get there.\n\nIn addition to the great food, they have deli items for sale, specialty pasta, bread, wine, etc. Everything you need to be a hero in the kitchen. \n\nThe one thing that's a bit odd are the signs on the soda fountain admonishing people not to steal soda, if they have a free water cup. That seems more like a sign you'd see in a Circle K in a shitty area- not a great deli. Maybe they can lose the sign, it kinda isn't in keeping with the classy feel of the food, ambiance and people.","507365":"Best steak and cheese I've had in years. This delightful east coast sandwich is rarely prepared well in this part of the country. I came back for another and will continue to frequent this place when I'm in town. I had the Uber take me here in the way to the airport. It's a great classic Italian deli and reminds me of my New England roots. Highly recommended.","508358":"Great food. Unfortunately, they get real busy and it's like a sit down fine dinning experience.","509410":"I'm Italian. From the NorthEast. \nPlaces like DeFalco's are all over the place back home. So, living in AZ (outside of the insane culture shock I went through when I moved here) left a void in my life!\nBut then, husband and I found DeFalco's.\nThe cheesecake! The lupini beans! The sandwiches! The pizza!\nand OH MY GOD THE PROSCIUTTO!\n\nWhen it's Friday night and Husband and I don't want to go out - we run to DeFalco's, grab some grub to snack on and watch a movie at home. Perfect!","510089":"Love this place! I've been here a few times with friends and never had a bad visit. The food is amazing and all of the staff are really nice! \nI had the chicken parm, a slice of chocolate\/ vanilla moose cake and a chocolate cannoli. All of these were amazing. \nMy roommate had the gnocchi, a slice of some kind of white cake, and a cappuccino. My roommate is Italian and grew up eating gnocchi and absolutely loved DeFalco's. \nI always recommend this place to friends looking for some good Italian food!","510392":"Hey Paisan, This is as authentic as it is good. The deli sandwiches were delicious and the cannoli for desert was great.\nA wonderful selection of wines compliment the authentic Italian foods.\nWe sat out on the patio which was very relaxing.\nWould highly recommend this place for anyone who'd like to go to Italia but can't afford the flight.","510499":"Great sandwich shop with a couple dozen sandwich options and awesome deli. Well worth The visit. I had half a meatball sub and half a steak and cheese with mushrooms onions and peppers. I got 2 halfs instead of a full sandwich because I couldn't decide between the two. I could only eat half of each of the halfs. And then for dessert I had a chocolate covered cannoli. It's a fun ambience with tables spread around the Italian deli. Looks like a great place to shop for meats and cheeses as well and they also have a lot of Italian related ingredients. I look forward to coming back soon ( but unfortunately don't live around town ) and trying a few of the other sandwiches - it was hard to choose so many look so good and the meats were so fresh.","510940":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant\/take out spot in the Phoenix-metro area. Having grown up in NY\/NJ I can attest that the quality and experience of Defalco's food and atmosphere makes me feel like I'm back home. The cheesesteak is my guilty pleasure as well as the pizza, desserts, gelato, chicken alfredo and chicken parm sandwich. I have read some of the previous reviews about the customer service being perceived as rude, and I could not disagree anymore with those remarks. Sometimes it gets really busy here since it is a very popular spot with many regulars, so keep in mind the lines can get long and this I have observed is when non-regulars get all antsy. Take a deep breath and know that the wait will be well worth it.","510950":"Super Friendly Awesome Helpful Staff! It was so busy it was a bit intimidating at first, but after we entered we realized they had everything under control! The line moved fast and the ambience was welcoming and calm. The food was unbelievable! and the dough even better! We re-heated our sausage and pepper sandwiches for dinner and the bread was even better heated (in the microwave!) A must go to for locals and visitors alike!!","511166":"Great little deli with fresh meats and bread. Reasonable pricing with a nice quiet dining area. Does take a while but it just makes the food taste better!","511693":"I've been here at least 5 times and I'm always satisfied. \n\nIts put together differently inside.. half grocery store half restaurant, but its cool and different than the conventional lobby of a restaurant. And truth be told actually makes you more likely to talk with other people while your there, something that's been missing these days. \n\nSo the food is made fresh to order, and with that some things take more time than others to get.. but isn't that a good problem to have? The only actual problem I see is that when someone comes in super excited with really big hopes because Defalco's has such a great rating they tend to get disappointed by the little things that usually wouldn't disappoint them... because their expecting the best food ever.. but its not the best ever. Now dont get me wrong I can literally eat there every day and always be happy and stuffed, but your always gonna have a better pasta at a pasta place or pizza at a pizza place. Its that thing that hurts... their blessing can be a curse","511766":"We've been coming here for years and it definitely has changed in the last year. We ordered the whole Italian sub and it was so dry and the bread was so cold it was almost frozen. The lasagna had no flavor. The only good thing was the cannoli premade at the pastry counter. The service has gone downhill as well. It took over 40 minuets to get our food.  Their was no sense of urgency for an almost empty restaurant. If your looking for an authentic Italian deli this is unfortunately not the place anymore.","512382":"Casual atmosphere and plenty of deli food.  We ordered the meat & sausage sandwich and they forget the sausage.  It was no problem with a quick addition.  Also ordered the chicken pesto sandwich.  Yum!  Tasty food that's consistent.","513213":"This place definitely gets 5 stars. Defalco's has the best cheesesteak you can get in the desert. I have yet to have one that compares. Unfortunately I now live 30 minutes from Defalco's, so I can no longer visit as often as I like.\n\nThe only real downside to this place is the wait-- if it's busy, you're gonna wait at least 20 minutes.","513354":"This place is amazing and all things Italian.  From rare pastas to a unique authentic Chianti...they got it covered.  It's a lunch restaurant, deli, and shop all in one.  I fired up a chicken salad sandwich to go and while waiting got some imported prosciutto and Italian wine.  I'll be back for the gnocchi and gelato!  If you love Italian as much as I do definitely check this place out.","513421":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):\n1 star:  Never again.\n2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.\n3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.\n4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.\n5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.\n\nUsed to live down the street and miss the place.  Came back after a long hiatus to see if anything has changed for the worse or better.\n\nMy first foray into Defalco's was the cheesesteak.  This is not your traditional Philly cheesesteak.  The Italian cheese mix is thick and rich, almost creamy, like a mornay.  This is very filling, stick-to-your-ribs cheesesteak.  And it's good.  The bread is substantial and chewy enough to stand up to the filling and there is plenty of cheese and plenty of beef.  Definitely one of the best menu items, but again, don't expect a taste of Philly.\n\nOn our last visit, ordered a couple sandwiches and a pasta dish.  The linguini with clam sauce is substantial.  It comes with a side salad and an order of garlic bread, and the pasta itself is quite large.  Some fresh clams on top and what I presume to be canned clams throughout.  The noodles were al dente enough - maybe just a little overcooked.  The main issue was seasoning.  It was underseasoned - almost criminally so.  It needed a big hit of salted butter or some parmegiano, something.  It wasn't a bad linguini and clam sauce, but it wasn't great.\n\nAlso ordered the Maximus and the Il Purista.  The Il Purista is quite good, and they put in enough prosciutto to balance out the rest of the sandwich.  I can't say the same for the Maximus.  Came in expecting an overstuffed Italian grinder given that it lists ham, salami, mortadella, pepperoni.  Just one or two slices each didn't give the sandwich enough substance, as opposed to the Il Purista.\n\nOne other small critique - if you order in, the place is a maze of Italian dry goods, so the server has a tough time finding you, especially when it's busy.\n\nSo come.  Definitely come for the sandwiches.  The cheesesteak especially, but the cold sandwiches are good too.  We'll give other pastas a try but I don't really recommend the linguini with clam sauce.","517262":"I've only been here once, but I have to give it a 5--this was easily the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten.  Every aspect of it was perfect, from the freshly made bread that was crisp on the outer layer and chewy inside, to the wonderfully sauteed peppers and onions, it was mouth-watering just to gaze upon.  They use white American, which is a requirement to me for a good cheesesteak (don't come at me with this provolone stuff, not on a cheesesteak).  All this goodness for $5.  How can you beat that??\n\nI also picked up some great quality ingredients for my next homemade pizza while I was there--San Marzano tomatoes, imported pepperoni from Chicago, and some cherry peppers.","519139":"I have been waiting to try this place for a while and was disappointed by lackluster service, cold entrees, and an item missed on the to go order. When we walked in, there was a line of customers watching the cashier take a phone order for an extended period of time. When he finishes the call, he walks away from the register without saying anything. Meanwhile, a family is asking if they can clear some tables of dirty dishes since there was nowhere to sit. When our food was brought out, the lasagna was somewhat warm, but the eggplant parmesan was nearly room temperature. The garlic bread was so loaded with butter that it was soggy and also room temp. I don't know why we ordered desserts- maybe because we were still trying to figure out what made everyone suggest dining here? Well, we ordered 3 items to go and purchased a couple of items from the grocery. After leaving, we found out that the cashier failed to give us the tiramisu. We will not be returning.","519156":"My family has been loyal to DeFalco's since its Phoenix inception back in 1972.  For me, this is home away from home.  Stepping in to DeFalco's takes me back to the days where we'd spend all day in Grandma's kitchen preparing for Sunday family dinner.  Preparing everything from homemade sauce, meatballs, chicken parmesan, and almond biscotti to name a few. \n\nDeFalco's offers an extensive menu (both for takeout and dine-in), and although I venture here 2-3 times per week I remain loyal to a few selections on their menu.  If you are feeling like a sandwich I urge you to order the homemade Meatball Sandwich on the crispy baguette - or - if you're feeling like chicken then I must recommend you try the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (again, on the crispy baguette).  I'm a hot\/toasted sandwich type of girl so I can't speak for the cold sandwiches, but I can assure you won't be disappointed with any selection given that all their breads are delivered fresh daily, meats and cheeses are sliced to order in house, and their toppings are fresh to boot!  To complete my go-to list I also recommend trying the Chicken Pesto Salad and a few side salads including the tuna pasta salad (BEST EVER), the chicken caesar pasta salad, pesto pasta salad, and....the tomato and basil salad (of course you must drizzle a little evoo and balsamic to make it truly Italian). They also offer many pasta dishes, pizza\/calzones, soups & sides, salads and desserts, oh my, and nothing will leave you disappointed or starving for more since their portions are generous in size (it's an Italian thing)!!  \n\nAnd not only does DeFalco's do Italian favorites just right, but their store is also stocked with Italian specialty foods for purchase (hint grocery in the name), and many wonderful and rare wine selections only to be found in their store.  \n\nMy Sunday dinner now belongs to DeFalco's as it makes me feel like I'm back at Grandma's place.  Heck, you can sip on some vino while you await your lunch or dinner to be served in the dining room or outside on the terrace!  And although this beloved establishment resides in Scottsdale, please remember to check your pretentiousness at the door because this place is loved for its traditions and laid back people.","519211":"I am moving and will I miss this place.  Everything I have eaten has been outstanding.  The steak and cheese may be one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  Calzone is huge!  Deli counter is outstanding as are the other items on the shelves.  What a selection of wines and oils!  This is a can't miss place!","519297":"Finally, my first chance to try DeFalco's.  Not gonna add much that hasn't already been said, but yes its awesome.  Super authentic Italian deli and grocery store.  The interior is a maze, the food is incredible and the prices are just right.  Tonight for my first visit I got a full Il Purista sandwich, a traditional cannoli, and a glass of Italian red wine to boot.  Total cost was about $20.  Came out in just over 5 minutes.  \n\nI'm not quite ready to say the sandwich was up to the level of one that I had at San Francisco's Molinari deli, but its pretty damn close.  The sandwich has tons of prosciutto and mozzarella, plus basil, tomato, red peppers, EVOO, and a balsamic vinaigrette.  I got mine in an italian baguette per their recommendation.  The sandwich was huge and the ingredients were fantastic.  The cannoli was also excellent with a rich creamy filling and sweet shell with just the right amount of crunch.\n\nSo yes, the Yelp reviews are accurate and the accolades are well deserved.  Anthony DeFalco and his family have done an excellent job carving their own niche in a valley restaurant scene saturated with Italian establishments.  Here it's not just about the pizza or the pasta, its about the whole Italian culinary experience from the restaurant, to the grocery store, to the butcher, and so on.  Truly a valley landmark in every sense of the word.","519326":"This place has been one of my perennial favorites for over 10 years. I love the subs, eggplant parm and greek vegetarian and two faves. The platters are great too. Tons of great deli salads and all the best ingredients an Italian grocer should have.","519577":"Went to this place for the first time after seeing it on TV,  talking about how good the food is here. The food was okay, but the service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes for our food, and when I went up to the counter to ask for a To-Go box for my left over, the guy was really rude and annoyed by me asking for a box, and when I asked for a second box he said \" oh! so now you want another one?\", when I went back to switch out for a larger box, he rolled his eye and start talking to himself...\" Just want to thank them for making it easy for me to NOT EVER WANT TO GO BACK!!!   Lesson learned---never trust the TV show! I think it was Food Channel.","519591":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I had the meatball sandwich and it was just ok, kind of bland though.  Maybe would have been better if I added giardiniera?  Probably won't be back.","519659":"It took us a minute to figure out how to order at this place, but once we did, we had a really good experience. You have to figure out which counter to go to to place your order, but once you do and get your food, it's outstanding. We had the baked ziti with homemade sausage, and it was fantastic. The side dishes are also excellent, particularly the mustard potato salad. It's also a grocery store, with all kinds of tempting Italian delights. The dessert display also caught our eye, but unfortunately we were too full to partake! Highly recommended for a unique and delicious lunch experience.","519756":"I found this on Food on TV, which shows all the Food Network visited places.  Anyway, I almost went to Olive Garden, so please forgive an out of towner.\nFood was great, especially for a pre-half marathon carbo load.  Counter man was super helpful.  Didn't really like having to go back up for second beer, but what they hey.  Small chicken parm was good for a runner, a big guy would want a full.  Playoff game was on TV, which was cool, and place was not a zoo.\n\nWhile I was drawn to the cookies, the price made my eyes pop and wallet shrink, so I passed.\n\nAll in all, for dinner, YES!","520004":"I forget who told me about this place but thank God for them!\n\nI have never had a bad meal here. My fave sandwich is the sausage w\/ peppers and onions. Oh so good. And I love that they have Dr. Brown's soda. The line is usually all the way back to the door, but it's so worth it.\n\nI love that the tables are set among the groceries. Ive never had need to go there for anything but lunch, but I like that while waiting in line you can peruse their grocery\/deli selections.\n\n2 words: go here!","520410":"Saw this place on diners, drive in's and dives. Guy made it look really good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but twice now I have just been lukewarm on this place. Got a sausage sandwich, roll was hard and way too much red sauce. It was a mess and not the good kind. The pizza was average nothing I would crave.","520668":"I have been a customer of Defalco's Italian Grocery\/Deli for years and years and years. I love it there! As of late I have been sticking with the spaghetti and although there have been a couple of times I found it a little overly salted, for the most part it's perfect every time! The bf is a fan of the sausage and beef combo, only he adds Havarti, with a sub roll and substitutes the marinara for Alfredo and calls it a day. Last night I had the linguine in white clam sauce. It was impressive to say the least. The portion was far larger than I had expected it to be, although I had no trouble finishing it all. Of course we'll be back, we always are.","520695":"Whenever I come here I get all melancholy thinking about shopping at the local Italian grocery store in Chicago me and my mom. Good memories of my child come back to life in this store.","520971":"I've been here more times than I can count & it is always delicious. \nUsually pretty busy and hard to find seating, but the food is enough to keep me coming back. \nThey have added pizza to the menu which I have yet to try, but looks amazing. \nThey have also added a lot more Italian items to their grocery than when I first started coming & organized it a little better. Wonderful!","521339":"Saw this on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dibes and happened to be in town and decided to try it. It's absolutely amazing! The food was delicious and the wait wasn't terrible. I would definitely come back!","521348":"Wife LOVES this place. Former Italian resident. Took her here once we came back every day for a week straight it seemed like. Sandwiches, bread, phenomenal.","521366":"Their eggplant parmesan was BOMB DOT COM. I also had a cup of the cappuccino and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is really neat because you are eating in a grocery store. Love it.","521644":"Got some fresh lasagna sheets. Turned into dinner fantastically easy and tasted great.","522076":"I have lived here 4 years and also visited my family out here growing up. Anyways I knew this place has been opened what seems like a long time. I told my aunt were trying it.....and it was sooooo good! Best ingredients with a long list of what Italian food you want. So I'll have to come back and try more. And the grocery store is great.","522078":"This Italian Deli is top notch. Their portions are huge and the quality of the food is really good. The Chicken dishes are particularly amazing .","522492":"Fantastic enviroment with great food and great service. A little taste of Italy away from Italy.","522606":"I have been back since my last review twice and I have to say I have been quite happy with my other food choices! I have not yet had the chicken parmesan again, for I like to try other dishes. The Baked Ziti and the Spaghetti and sausage were both quite delicious. My last review wasn't a bad review a 3 star is still pretty good, but I have to say I feel better now giving it a few more tries and upping my rating to 4 stars.","523202":"my husband and i loved the cheese steak sandwich. A full  sandwich is enough for two. Also cant go wrong with caprese salad -- probably better if they used arugula.  We're excited to try their pizza and wine next time","524677":"This place was so good my husband and I could not believe it. Triple D does not lie we came all the way from Toronto just for this little gem. Great sandwiches and anywhere you can drink wine at noon without judgement is great in my books. Friendly staff and fresh product it was the best!","525543":"Great hot sandwiches. I would highly recommend. Hidden off the West side of Scottsdale Road. Small interior. I would expect a wait if you hit the noon crowd. I've never seen anyone shop at deli, but the shelves break up the restaurant nicely.","525628":"I stumbled on to this place while looking for cannoli shells.  I couldn't pass up eating here so I got the 'Il Purista'.  It reminded me of my grandmother's food and the real Italian food you can get on the east coast.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the wait to get my food.  Don't get me wrong though, it was worth the wait.","526241":"Incredible!  Many, many leaps above somewhere like Olive Garden!  The fettucine chicken Alfredo was fantastic, as was the chocolate mouse cake (so silky smooth)!  The eggplant, mushroom, and spinach calzone was amazing, the crust was soft all around and the flavors were perfect.","526351":"Imported delightes from all over...\nTheir food is great, and I end up picking something to take home every time.\nOh yeah, their coffee and Cannoli are the best!","526386":"If you're looking for good food, a cozy environment, and anything Italian, this is the place to go! Came here on a recommendation, and I'm so glad I did! I got an Italian combo and it was amazing. Walked around the store for a little bit, and found 00 flour, Italian cookies, and a restaurant in the back! It was busy and I totally understand why. They have a large variety of fresh pastas and cheese. Deli meat galore. I will certainly be back to eat on the restaurant part of it.","526656":"Amazing fresh food and on the spot import deli meats and cheeses. Super amazing cheese steak. Best around. Friendly staff and all about quality!","526996":"My husband and I were in a rush so we stopped by here to grab sandwiches... Sandwiches were AMAZING! however it was not fast. Took about 10 minutes to get our sandwich but although we were a bit rushed, it was worth the wait. Service is great too.","527430":"Really great Italian food!  Cute really charming spot with sweet staff.  We ordered the margherita pizza, stuffed shells, and baked ziti. All were really good but the stuffed shells were my personal fav.  Would def come back for dinner and the market.  It's so freaking quaint.  Loved it.  Only reason I didn't give it a five star was because I wasn't blown away by the dishes.  But it will be a mainstay in my restaurant repertoire.  Just a great Italian joint.","527696":"If it's your first time at Defalco's, then you must order the cheesesteak!!! Best sandwich on the menu, although everything on the menu seems to be the best.  Pizzas are crazy fresh and delicious. Try a cannoli for dessert!  Defalco's needs to be open late night...seriously!","527814":"two words: FRICKIN YUM!\n\nWhenever the boyfriend and I drive down Scottsdale Road the boyfriend ALWAYS has to mention that he wants to try out Defalco's...so, last night I did my homework and yelped Defalco's before giving it a go.  I decided the reviews were pretty damn awesome and that I would have to go by for lunch. \n\nOk, this place...so amazing.  It's seriously like Italy decided to give birth to a small little grocery store in the middle of a pretty lame plaza to grace Arizona with its presence.  It's got racks and racks of Italian wines, balsamic vinegars, Italian breads and sweets.  They've also got some frozen pasta to cook up in your own home. Anyway, let's get to the good stuff.  As many have mentioned it does get packed during lunch so expect a wait.\n\nThe boyfriend got a full chicken parmigina sandwich. It was pretty good and a HUGE serving.  He got it on the soft roll and they do not skimp out on the chicken.  The roll was filled with perfectly breaded chicken breast, topped with a simple, yet flavorful marinara sauce and of course...so cheese. YUM. Like I said it was pretty big and filling and it was $7.50.\n\nI took fellow Yelpers suggestions and got a half order of the beef cheese steak with mushrooms, onions, and peppers. Heaven in the mouth for $5. Enough said.\n\nOne star off for the wait but it was worth it!","528274":"What can you say about this place that hasnt already been said. When I am close by it is usually my go to joint for lunch the sandwiches are awesome and I usually enjoy taking a few bakery items home for desert that night or for breakfast the following morning.","528300":"Estuvo deliciosa, buen servicio, gente muy amable; lo recomiendo ampliamente, ordenamos pizza chicken riqu\u00edsima y la lasagna de cuatro quesos","528313":"Stopped in here on our way to Luminarias in the Garden at the Desert Botanical Garden. We had the grilled portobello sandwich and the caprese salad, both delicious. It was also happy hour, so we both got glasses of wine for $4! They have a great selection of pastas (like pappardelle, which I can never find!) and sauces. They even have muffuletta filling!! Friendly staff and plenty of seating on this Friday night at 6 pm!","528561":"Great prices, great big portions (enough to take home and save for another day), and a huge menu where everyone is bound to find something! As a vegetarian I was so happy to see FRIED EGGPLANT SANDWHICH!!!! Everything I have had here has been amazing and my friends all say it's the best philly cheese steak sandwich they have had in a long time!!!! I always take potato salad to go!!! Can't get enough of this place!!!","529186":"Great place with lots of options! No fuss feel to it. From Pizza to sandwiches, salads, desserts. Everything I have had is delicious. My favorite being the spinach and chicken salad with goat cheese and pine nuts! Huge salad, always fresh and a great price! For dessert I love the almond biscotti. \n\nWhile you wait for your food there's a whole Italian grocery to check out. Stuffed olives, fancy olive oil, noodles, wine, they have everything. It's a fun place to check out with delicious eats. I also love that they do a punch card to show appreciation to their customers.","529553":"I heart Defalco's.  My boyfriend and I are here at least once a month.  Weirdly enough I've never actually sat down for lunch or dinner at the actual location. We usually just do take out or just buy items from the grocery part of it.  They have a great variety of dried pastas, wine, cheeses, oils and vinegar's, etc.  Whenever we have friends over we love to order a variety of pastas for pick up.\n\nWhat the two of us end up doing most often is just picking items out from the grocery to make homemade pizza.  Their fresh pizza dough is seriously to die for.  And it's only around $1!  If you don't see it in the fridge be sure to ask.  They usually have some in the back.","529859":"I like the laid back atmosphere and cafe \/ deli style of DeFalco's. Portion size could be bigger but the food was really good! Staff was nice and service was prompt. Look forward to coming back.","530187":"Have to give it the full 5. This is a great little market with big time italian food. This is the type of Italian deli market back in Jersey or NY.","531119":"This is a deli - market, strictly Italian. I had the stuffed shells for lunch one afternoon. If you go during the rush hour be prepared to stand in a long line and wait for your food. However if you have the time to wait it's definitely an enjoyable meal. They have a wide range of meals, small and large, heavy and light. And a fantastic dessert spread. It wasn't the best Italian food in the world but for the price and style of the meal it's a great stop and I recommend it.","532752":"Good place to get all the things you need Italian and can't get else where. Although they can get a bit pricy here! But I haven't found any other places in az that sell the good italian foods!","534019":"Wow. The food here is just amazing. Small Mom and pop place. Everything we tried was delicious. especially dessert! Try their \"pink\" sauce.","534908":"Great food! If you want Italian this is the place to go! Great homey atmosphere to the place also","535015":"ZOMG - the chicken fettucine alfredo is ridiculous\nSO x 100 good\nmy lactose intolerant gut withstood the pain\nand let my tastebuds enjoy themselves\n\nthe chicken parm sandwich was just ok\ni don't like when the breading on the chicken gets soggy and falls off\nalso, the breading wasn't very flavorful or crispy\nmeh\n\noh yeah, and that chocolate, praline, caramel cheesecake\nto DIE foe","536208":"We eat there alot and we have never had a bad meal. It is recommended to call ahead to place your order.","536368":"In my original review four years ago, I said:\n\nI'll make it simple.  Come for the food, and stay to shop.  Or, come here to shop, and stay for the food!  Either way, you cannot go wrong!\n\nWe have been coming here for over eight years, going back to their previous location. They've grown and yet they still need more room. \n\nAt DeFalco's we love the food, the Italian sandwiches, the cold cuts (mostly Capocola), bread, frozen Ricotta filled Ravioli, Wine, and that was only our shopping list for today.  LOL\n\nAs I said in my Check-In, it's hard to get out of here for under a $100. But it's money well spent!","536369":"I have been going to DeFalco's since 1984 when they were at the old location on 68th and Thomas. I have eaten at other Italian delis all over the Valley but this place has no rivals. The quality of the food is excellent, and the staff gets to know all of the customers as they continue to return. I highly recommend the Purista, CHP, cheese steak, Margerite pizza, the Tim's Special pizza, and the soups. Go for Italian items - they can't be beat. The wine selection is also fantastic. Tony DeFalco, the owner, tries every single wine before putting a bottle on the shelves, and he has fantastic wines from a number of regions. I can't say enough about this place. I eat here at least three times a week and have for many years. Healthy and delicious. Make sure to call orders in ahead as this place gets really busy. DeFalco's is a true desert classic with 100 year old recipes, some of friendliest staff around, and a dedication to excellence.","537334":"My family and I have been customers here for decades. Easily the best Italian Deli in Scottsdale. Great selection of imported meats and cheeses. They also have a great lunch menu. Can't recommend this place enough. Defalco's food has been a mainstay of every family gathering since I was a young boy and even as an adult, I can't get enough of their quality food.","537448":"You want authentic Italian in AZ you go to Defalco's!  When you walk in you get hit with the authentic Italian smells of Italy.  Their dishes are a mix of the old school and new school Italian and you can tell their recipes have been handed down for generations.  Their staff is super friendly and treat you like family.  Defalco' was also on the Food Network's DDD, so you know they are throwing out some amazing food!  The food is Phenomenal.  You really cannot go wrong with anything on their menu especially if it has their in house made sausage.  Here is what I recommend when you go to Defalco's:\n\nMeatball Hot Sandwich: Comes with House made Meatball, with melted cheese on a sub roll.  You get the soft chewiness of the sub roll then there house made marinara sauce with the perfectly cooked, tender, juicy meatball, then the nice creaminess melted cheese.  Best Meatball Sandwich I have ever had.\n\nItalian Sausage with Peppers and Onions: Made with in house made sausage, red and green bell peppers, onions, and melted cheese on a sub roll.  Another awesome sandwich that was on DDD (Diners, Drivins, and Dives).  Off the first bite you again you get the soft chewiness of the sub roll then the snap of the sausage casein loaded with spices, then the hit of the sauteed peppers and onions, then on the back end you get the amazing flavor of the house made tomato sauce and melted cheese.  Straight on mouth punch to the taste buds!\n\nMy Favorite Sandwich Chicken Parmigiana: Made Lightly fried and breaded chicken with melted mozzarella & topped with out home-made sauce on a sub roll.  Best sandwich on the menu!  Once again right off the bat you get the soft chewiness of the sub roll then you get the nice tender, juicy white meat chicken with the light crunch from the breaded crust of the chicken.  Once you get past that awesomeness you then get hit with the amazing home made tomato sauce and the melted mozz!  I am telling you its a must have!\n\nIf you are going to get an amazing pizza you have to go with the  Chicken Pesto Pizza: The Pizza is Grilled Chicken, Pesto Sauce, Cheese, Fresh Tomato, then I added sausage, and ricotta cheese.  The pizza crust is perfectly cooked.  Not to crunchy, but soft, chewy, pull apart greatness.  Your first bite you get that delicious crust, hit with the amazing pesto and fresh tomato, next the juicy tenderness of the chicken and the spices of the sausage, then you get the nice creaminess of the ricotta cheese on the back end.  There is a lot going on but you have multiple amazing flavor layers that your brain will thank you for!\n\nYou are looking for the most authentic Italian in AZ and be treated like an Italian family?  Go to Defalco's!  Welcome to the Family!\n\nBrandonFitFoodie","537781":"Hats off to the family who owns this place.  Great authentic food at good prices in a fun atmosphere makes for a winning combination.\n\nJust don't let it get to your head.\n\nOh, and be sure to call in and order instead of just swinging by during your lunch break.  Shaves off about 15-20 minutes of waiting.","538646":"I have been going to DeFalco's for 25+ years and they will bring back memories of walking into a East coast Italian deli. The smells are wonderful and the food is excellent.\nMuch of the staff has been there for many years and are friendly.\n\nI have watched them grow from their original tiny location on Thomas and 42nd St. to\nthe Thomas and 68th St. to their present location.\n\nYes the present location could be larger but that has happened every time they have moved and found more fans to crowd their dining areas.\n\nI go there every time I am in the neighborhood.","539444":"Heavenly Italian sandwiches.  Best ingredients and fresh.  Felt like I was in NYC for lunch.  Best Italian lunch spot I have found in the metro Phoenix area.  Wish they had a location in Chandler.","539630":"My wife and I were craving Italian food so we drove to Defalcos.  We ordered linguine and clams and a Italian sandwich.   The linguine and clams were excellent.  The sandwich however was disappointing.  Whoever sliced the meats left the casing on.  Whenever you bit into the meat you had this stringy casing you had to remove from your mouth.  I brought it to one of the cashiers attention and they didn't seem to care.  I still love this place but it must instill better quality control in their workers.  I just hope this is a one off because if it is not the restaurant is doomed.","540722":"Here again over the 4th of July weekend.  They were slammed due to another airing of their great Diners, Driven Ins and Dives episode so the wait was a little longer than usual-but totally worth it!  I am happy to wait a little longer than a 5 min McDonald's order for quality, homemade food at extremely reasonable prices.  My favorite item is their pizza (I order the white pizza with capacollo)  but they also make a mean turkey sandwich!  My family also loves the Chicken Parm sub and the meatball sub.","540766":"We heard of this place after seeing it on the food network channel and had to give it a shot. DeFalcos was amazing! Authentic and so tasty! I recommend the Italian sausage sub with peppers and onions and the lasagna w\/ meat! The New York style cheesecake was amazing too. Will for sure be back!","540885":"Great deli with a fantastic calzone. You can certainly taste the high quality cheese they use. Hands down best i have ever had.","542293":"The food is awesome! The pizza is made with fresh ingredients and is so delicious. The subs are great too...meatball especially! I highly recommend","543663":"Best Italian sausage and Pepper sandwich I have ever had. That sauce with a little fire from the sausage.  Oh man make you want to slap yo momma !!!! Good stuff Maynard","545298":"Best spaghetti!  The people here are awesome!  Defalco's is a family owned restaurant and the food is great!  Make sure to try them out.","546143":"I had an amazing meatball sandwich and tried they're homemade sandwich. Marinara sauce was on point. I also enjoyed that it was inside an actual Italian market.","548631":"Amazing food, so many choices, reasonable prices, all around great place that I can't wait to try for a second (and third) time!","548664":"Absolutely everything I've had here has been freaking delicious! The chicken parmigiana, various pizzas, the hot sandwiches, pasta, desserts.. This place is a gem.","548842":"Ok...this place is super cool. I haven't been here forever and I stopped in 2 days in a row! I tried the arancini, which was full of flavor, beef, peas and deliciousness. I did the fettuccine alfredo and it was creamy and garlicky. Yummmm. And I did a cannoli as well. Perfection. The next day, I went back for mini cannolis for a party I was going to. They made a fresh batch and they were a hit. I cannot wait to go back and explore more of this menu. Also, the staff is all super friendly and knowledgeable.","549300":"I love Defalco's.  I hate Defalco's.  The food is always fresh and I'm never disappointed.  The big problem is that the service is so slow.  It's  great that they have a market for you to look around while you are waiting for your food.  I know I can get quality tasting food but I have to here when I know I'm not in a rush to be somewhere.","551166":"Love, love, love this place. I have never ordered anything I did not like. Their chicken Caesar pasta salad is the best!","551228":"Great Italian Grocery and restaurant! Its a small place but totally worth it, especially for the price! You cannot beat it! The staff is very helpful and willing to go out of their way to make sure you're satisfied!","551575":"We drive from West Phoenix to eat here and what a disappointment we have always gotten good food here. But today I ordered eggplant parmigiana it was terrible and for my grandson spaghetti the both meals were cold.  And there was water on the bottom of spaghetti they didn't drain the noodles enough before serving the plate. What a disappointment to drive that far for food that we love and to be disappointed. Maybe next time but if it happens again then never again.","552386":"Went here in yelp reviews . So glad we did the food was delicious . I had the eggplant parm which was one of the best I have ever eaten and my husband had the sausage sandwich which he also enjoyed . price was also very good for the amount they gave you. Carrot cake was also very good . Will def return","554807":"Great NY Italian deli and grocery. Authentic Italian desserts,pasta, sauces, olives, peppers and so much more. \nFriendly and welcoming. Go check it out!!\nLove this place","556395":"This is a great Italian place very good food and sandwiches I personally love the cold cuts from here very fresh The appetizers are really good to The meatballs are amazing The anti-pasta salad is one of my favorites my wife stops in very often to pick up some ingredients and fresh sausage we love Italian food it's our favorite highly recommend this place come try it out","557005":"This place has pretty good food. Doesn't amaze me but at the same time I would go back. They just remodeled so it's very nice and they do have a patio area:)","557372":"After seeing that this place had Guy Fieri's approval on DDD, I was really eager to try....\n\nUnfortunately it only earns a solid \"mehh.\"\n\nThe sandwich bread is delicious (both the Italian sub and baguette). Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. BUT the actual sandwich toppings were bland and the meatball sub had an awkwardly disproportioned sauce to meatball ratio (way heavy on the sauce). I also ordered a bruschetta sandwich (only supposed to have cheese, tomato & basil), but it tasted like some kind of deli meat..... weird..... \n\nWouldn't go out of my way to go back, but might stop by if I randomly happened to be passing by.","557737":"I finally made it over to this place after bookmarking it about a year ago. I ordered the Purista and I wasnt impressed. They screwed up my order and put the oil and vinegar on it. I specifically asked for it on the side. So instead of starting over, they included cups with extra on the side. Ew. By the time I got home it was soggy. The flavors were good but definitely not worth the price. I thought everything was overpriced actually. I dont mind spending a decent amount for a sammich but that was a rip off. I browsed the other items available and the selection was extensive and crammed into a super tiny space. I don't think I will be back.","558219":"This place is the real deal. I haven't ordered a sandwich yet, but this is my deli of choice when purchasing Italian meats, bread, salads, pastries, etc. It's quite a ride from the West Valley but well worth it. Can't wait to try a cheese-steak!","559221":"Food was Ok , pizza was so so, Pomo's is better, sandwich was ok jimmy johns and potbellys is better my girls baked ziti was good though, \nWon't be back sorry... Not enough flava for this Dego.iiiii","559538":"Place is awsome.  Got the beef cheesesteak and everything was great.  The bread was possibly the best I have ever had.  Price was pretty good.  Just over 9 bucks for a whole sammich and soda.  While waiting I walked around and I plan on going back for some shopping.  Lots of pasta, sauces and just about anything you could want for Italian food.  5 stars all the way.","559994":"I'm from chicago, visiting my inlaws home in Scottsdale and saw this place featured on Triple D amd had to give it a try.  I'm glad we made the drive cuz the food was excellent.  I had the italian sausage with marinara sauce. And Motz cheese.  The only thing I would do differently is request the italian sausauge to be hot sausauge, vs the mild. \n\nOther than that, it was excellent!","560133":"Just tried DeFalco's tonight after it was featured in the weekly YELP newsletter on cheesesteaks. I had the margherita pizza and a dinner salad and enjoyed it.  The italian dressing was meh. No spices- just oil and vinegar. I expected it to be a special homemade type of dressing since this is an italian deli. \n\nBoth my husband and son had the cheesesteak. They loved it. The roll was great and that is very important to the whole package. It was meaty as well. My husband liked the fact that the cheese was mixed and melted into the steak. Not on the bottom of the roll or laying on top. My son didn't like the fact that they didn't have WIZ but he is a teenager and  well...if you have a teenager you know where I'm coming from. \n\nEven though we liked it, we like Philadelphia Sandwich Company better and it will be hard to go right by it to go to DeFalco's. \n\nAnother quick thing to mention. The guy taking our orders was not rude but his attitude was \"I'm doing you a favor by standing here taking your order\". So....I don't know if he was hung over or having a bad day but it was our first impression.","561261":"I kind of think this place is highly overrated.\n\nIt pisses me off because coming from Jersey this place is kind of weak.  Like others have stated the service is very slow and everytime I order hard Salami it is this little thinly sliced salami and I have never had it in any other Italian deli.  Not so good.\n\nThey do however sell jars of Centos products and I love the olive oil, cherry peppers, and pepperocinis so I will give them their due.\n\nGo for the products, but if you want a sub sandwich go down the street to Jersey Mikes.","562886":"Buonissimo! My boyfriend and I had lunch here with a caprese and a Italian sausage sandwich. They were both WONDERFUL! The caprese was so tasty and the mozzarella cheese so fresh and creamy. My boyfriend particularly appreciated the spicy Italian sausage. In addition, I had the Birra Moretti...the queen of Italian beers, so light and regenerative. I'm Italian from Milan and for me was like feeling home again. I've noticed that all the products they have are really authentic imported from Italy, and I think I'll buy some of the products for some Christmas presents. We'll definitely come back! \u00c9 stato spettacolare e ci ritorneremo presto. L'Italia \u00e9 sempre l'Italia.","563609":"This place is delicious! The guys are all great and their food is to die for. They have a nice beer\/wine selection and a great Italian grocery selection. The sandwiches and pizza are amazing. Try the IL Purista sandwich if you like prosciutto on a Caprese style sandwich! They also offer great Italian salads and sides, stuffed peppers, cheeses and desserts.  Definitely a must try!!!\n\n7\/23\/11** Ok it's been about 500 times that I've been here now and it's still delicious.","563623":"Defalco's.... I've been coming here since I was 14. I'm 24 now. That's 10 years and it's still  the only Italian spot I can go to and order ANYTHING on the menu and be  completely satisfied. I crave their clam sauce with pasta! The pizza sub! Literally any cold sandwich! But especially the pastas... And let's not forget the desserts.... not to mention they have a great selection of dry goods and wines to par-use while you wait in line. I seriously love this place - go and you will too!","563922":"They always get our order correct whenever we order from Defalco's for our office lunches.  The food is always hot and delicious.  I've never had something I didn't like from here, but my favorite is hands down the Philly Cheese steak (beef) from here.  It's so delicious and the cheese is melted and mixed with the meat before being placed on the bread.  I always get the fried peppers and mushrooms on mine as well.  All for a price that can't be beat.  I would recommend getting a whole sandwich instead of a half because it's twice the food for only a couple dollars more (a whole is probably around 12\"-14\" and I believe their make their bread in house.  Totally worth the price and visit!  Thinking about it right now is making me want to go get one!  This place is also worth checking out for their vast array of imported Italian goods as well as all the things they make in house.  My co-worker swears by their pasta salads.","564147":"Almost feels like a hidden Scottsdale gem, but every time we eat there it is BUSY!","564816":"This was my first visit and they were pretty busy, but the wait wasn't too long. There was still seating available so that was good. I shared a full sandwich with a friend which we were told it was 12 inches, but it seemed smaller than that. It was very good though. I recommended this place to a client and he loved it as well. I will definitely go back as they have an extensive menu to try.","565417":"I am from Philly and know about cheesesteaks. I had one today, and was disappointed. They're usually tender and flavorful, but this was tough and chewy. My husband had a chicken cheesesteak and loved it. The meatballs were bland too (the kid's lunch). Last time we were here it was better. We'll try it again. Maybe it was an off day. It's not a bargain though, so I'd expect a bit better.","566184":"This the best and only place to go for Italian food in Scottsdale. Their Pizza Bianca is the best I've ever had! All of their sandwiches are huge and authentic. The side salads are amazing. I bring people here from out of town because they are always blown away by how good the food is.","566327":"The staff is amazing. The food is superb. You don't wait long once you order and the portions are HUGE. Best of all its an italian grocery store as well. If you go there and you like kalamata olives you must try theirs. Best ive ever had.","566847":"In a rush this isn't the place at lunch, but man o man, are their sammys fantastic! Highly recommend!","567476":"Some of the best sandwiches in town I promise you that and an authentic deli, very nice wine as well ya Vinos","568147":"FOOD: I've had good experiences and bad experiences at Defalco's, so my rating may be lower than most. The cold sandwiches are good, but I had a pizza sub once and it was probably the worst thing I ate at an Italian restaurant in a while. I'm sure there are other great dishes available. The bread is fantastic, though. For sandwiches, I prefer Dilly's Deli. I haven't had any of the pasta dishes, though. \n\nPRICE: Decently priced with most items being under $10. \n\nATMOSPHERE: I love the market\/restaurant mix that I see a lot of around Tempe. Defalco's offers Italian cuisine ingredients right when you walk in the door. My most memorable experience was when I was eaves dropping on several middle-aged\/older men sitting at a table talking. They were obviously from New York with their thick accents and talked in an intimidating style much like mobsters. I would not be the least bit surprised if they were part of \"the family.\" Listening to their conversation and eating in a small Italian grocer was a great experience. Does anyone else notice that the bathroom is very large?\n\nSERVICE: Nice and helpful staff. \n\nSKINNY: I've had a bad experience along with good memories at Defalco's, so give it a try to see for yourself. But DONT get the pizza sub!","569069":"Don't understand the fuss about this place.  The first time I went I got a Caprese Salad.  It was a giant bowl of romaine and iceberg lettuce (I expected a handful or none at all), whole basil leaves (not tasty in a salad), pinkish\/greenish Roma tomatoes (yuck), fresh mozzarella (the only plus) and when I said I wanted balsamic for my dressing, that exactly what I got.  Balsamic vinegar.  No oil.  So weird.  The breadsticks had been warmed and cooled so many times they were like semi-chewy rubber.  And cold (again) when given to me.  I left totally confused.  \n\nDecided to try again because a friend swore he loved it.  I got the eggplant parmesan over linguini.  It was very good!  But again, cold, chewy, old breadsticks. The side salad had the same pinkish\/green Roma tomatoes (who EATS those horrible things!!???)  My friend (who talked me into going back again) got a chicken parmesan sandwich which was served on old bread that was so hard he couldn't bite thru parts of it.  He was very disappointed.  \n\nI will say this: the tiramisu was the best I have ever had.  Great cannoli too.  \n\nBut seriously: its really hard to take an italian place seriously when they serve terrible, old bread and can't tell the difference between the worst tomatoes ever and a good or even great, juicy, enjoyable red tomato.  \n\nNa mean?","569664":"You can't get any better than this place. It's fresh, family owned and they don't mess around when it comes to DELICIOUSNESS!!!!!!! They do it right and legit :) Their italian grocery is even better.. GO HERE!!!!! SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!! I wouldn't go anywhere else for italian food. YUMMO!!!!!!!","570312":"Oh my god.. Such a wonderful place.. With tons of options and great service our family went home happy :).\nUsually we find it tough to find a place with both veg and non veg options plus kids options. This one fit perfectly for everyone.","571603":"worst italian beef sandwich ever. No taste no flavor to the meat. sweet peppers were taste less\nand not roasted. tried everything ...added salt, put salad dressing on meat, added sauce.\nnope..nothing helped.","571912":"Tasty!  Being from the NYC area I am always looking for a good NY style Italian deli\/restaurant.  This is it!  Stop driving, turn into the parking lot, turn off the car and go inside and order.","572847":"Work is now closer to Defalcos and I'm pretty excited. The grocery part is still yet to be tested by me but they have a wide selection of wine, oils, cheese, meats, pasta and other things. \n\nThey make the food quickly, fresh, and you can see it with an open kitchen. \n\nI usually get the Philly Cheesesteak no onions and no mushrooms, extra peppers. It has been consistent and phenomenal every time. Never disappointed in the amount and I always leave full. The cheese is melted perfectly for me and I thoroughly enjoy it. Maybe one of the best Philly in Scottsdale. \n\nI get the pasta salad and antipasto salad as sides because I don't eat all the bread. All of it is great, fresh and I tastes wonderful!\n\nI will obviously be back and get items from the deli\/grocery to try them out. Super excited and I will be feasting.","572890":"Dear Yelpers.... thank you, thank you, thank you.  If it wasn't for you, I would have never found this hidden little gem.\n\nFood was amazing... and I'm super picky about my Italian.\n\nService was fabulous and I just had an over-all wonderful experience here.\n\nAnytime I am in the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area, I will be here again.","573455":"I'll be honest with you. I found out about this place from my Twitter feeds. They are big Sun Devil fans and a lot of my fellow Devils stop by this place. So of course I had to bookmark and try this place. \n\nWalking in there's shelves of Italian groceries but in between are tables to sit at. Inside are usually tables for two but outside they have bigger tables. So you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table. \n\nSo I ordered a half meatball and half beef cheesesteak with grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms with a Latte. I'm always looking for the best meatball sandwich in town and would have to put this at the top of my list. Freshly baked and toasted bread with two huge meatball and fresh mozzarella. Man this all came together. So good. So fresh. Loved it. The beef cheesesteak with thinly sliced ribeye was so good. The beef was so tender and juicy with that creaminess of the cheese and fresh mozzarella with peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Oh my goodness. Freaking good. Hit the spot. To top it off the latte just made this lunch to freaking over the top. Loved it. \n\nMy daughter and wife split a full meatball sandwich which they couldn't finish. Plus they ordered a cannoli. Oh my goodness. We all took a bite of that cannoli it was so good. Out of this world. So creamy. So good. You just have to try this. My son ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and he really liked it. Finished it all up. \n\nI really liked this places. The tables are small but the atmosphere was great. Great food. Good and friendly service plus they are Sun Devils. So Forks Up and enjoy","573670":"A nice little Italian grocery\/restaurant in a small, older plaza along Scottsdale rd.  \n\nThe store part of it had a good selection of deli meats and cheeses, as well as shelves of pastas and sauces.  I'm sure there were more things, but we were there for dinner, not shopping.\n\nWe ordered the large portions of Chicken Marsala and Stuffed Jumbo shells.  The marsala wine sauce was excellent, and the orders were very largely portioned.  The side salads were not the best, but the garlic bread made up for it.  The service we received was friendly.  It's probably not recommended to come here with a large group since seating is limited (It's more store than restaurant), unless you all sit outside.","573671":"Came for lunch. The place had a great Italian deli so I was even more excited to try the food. However it wasn't anything exciting. I also ordered a half sand but was charged for the full. Didn't realize till I had already left. So that was a little frustrating. Maybe they aren't known for the sandwiches or it was an off day. Overall it was just blah","573895":"I think this is my new favorite place...brings back so many memories of delicious, home cooked meals on the East Coast!  I ordered the jumbo stuffed shells and it came with a side salad and garlic bread, an Orangina and a cannoli.  I could not have been happier with my choices...yummy!  \n\nI am excited to head back here and pick up items for a picnic.  So many great choices of meats, cheeses, salads, desserts etc.  \n\nFriendly staff too!","574407":"Love this place! Food is amazing. Lasagna, Gnocchi, cheesecake.. I want to try everything on the menu! Environment is casual but allows for a special and intimate experience as well.","574810":"I wish I had discovered this gem sooner! This place has all the hard to find Italian goods you need for recipes, that you can never seem to find in the standard stores.","575229":"Go out of your way for this and bing an appetite!\n\nWe ordered carryout, having been told the seating is limited, and it proved to be a perfect choice.  No waiting and a relaxed pleasurably lunch on our own terms.  \n\nEverything sounds great on the menu and really end up doing a flow chart - hot or cold?  If hot, pasta, sandwich, pizza, etc. and if cold, salad or sandwich.  I went with cold.  The side of Antipasto Salad was so generous and had chunks of meat, cheese, peppers, olives and oil.  The meat were chunks right from the deli with Mortadella, Capocollo, salami and all were excellent.  The cheese and peppers along with the spices, made the salad taste fantastic.\n\nI also opted for the whole Maximus, again with the spicy prosciutto, and Capocollo, Mortadella, Genoa Salami provolone on focaccia.  The bread was soft and fluffy with a airy crumb that was seasoned to give it a hit of extra oregano.  The sandwich was dressed with cold, crunch iceberg, tomato, onion, mustard, mayo and of course, Italian dressing.  Excellent flavor combination - highly recommended.","575373":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had. Have been To Delfalcos a couple of times and they have never disappointed. From the pastas pizzas and salads everything is authentic and amazing this place is highly recommended!","575898":"This place lives up to its reputation and I always leave satsified.  One of my favorite places to go for good subs, italian cured meats, and antipasto. While it's setup as a mini market\/ deli, the market offerings are a little pricier than i've seen elsewhere.  \n\nBack to the subs tho - great crusty loaves, high quality meats, and made in true italian deli fashion. The also offer some traditional italian dishes if you're in the mood for a real meal.  \n\nWhile I usually just get a quick sub or am picking up some things to go, there are some tables to sit at if you choose.  Plus the people are pretty laid back and friendly.  Only complaint that I have is the traditional Euro-style reusable and communal towel in the restroom.  A little hard to shake considering how many people don't wash or don't wash properly.","576400":"Very good sandwiches plus an area to sit and enjoy your food. A very good variety of pastries . Tried the rainbow cookie and it was very good.","576700":"Purista sandwich! Coming off of a big night of booze and gambling it seemed like the right call. Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Tomato, Roasted Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Balsamic Vinegar. Come on! What's not to like about that ass kickin sandwich! The Crispy Baguette is the perfect vessel for all of these fresh and imported ingredients. We were lucky to get in and wait just a short period of time for our order. Great, no bullshit, straight forward sandwich and deli. Tony Soprano would be very proud of this Gastronomia! Will be back again, so many more things to try.","577163":"Outstanding food, great service, wait time (for me) not a big deal since I walk around the market.  Had meatball sub today, got it to go and it was still hot and fresh when I got home.  About 8 minutes later.  \n\nGet the hot italian sausage from the meat case.  I like to grill mine over charcoal then add to my sauce and my home-made pasta.  I like the hot....since I'm a \"spicy meatball\" myself.","577408":"This is my go to for Italian takeout and love the pasta, farro and risotto in the market place.  Recommend the marinara & meatballs, cheese steak, gnocchi.","578150":"Yum.! Had sausage and peppers and it was just like momma used to make! Great customer service!","578695":"Great food ! Their pizza crust is really good. We also ordered dinner salads and tiramisu...all which were great ! Nice patio to eat on too !\n\nThis place has the true Italian feel to it especially with the market inside. I'm from Pittsburgh and it reminds me of the Strip District when I come here :)\n\nI would definitely recommend.","578870":"Absolutely delicious. We have ordered calzones quite a few times and have never been disappointed in the slightest. We have even bought their dough and made our own pizzas and calzones. Ours didn't do theirs justice but it was still fun and tasty. The only thing I don't like about this Italian gem is it's pretty chaotic when you go in there. But that can definitely be overlooked with food this amazing!","578877":"When I first moved to AZ, this was the first place I felled in love with but it has been 5 years now and I finally made it back (after several visits back in the day).\n\nToday I had a sweet and sour experience.\n\nI was craving the lasagna but I'm trying to keep the diet so I ordered the soup of the day (minestrone) and a pasta side (penne with tomato sauce).\n\nThe soup was superb (that's why it didn't get 2 stars). The focaccia that came with the soup was pretty decent and the ice tea (green tea) was pretty tasteful.\n\nBut the side pasta was totally forgettable. The sauce was pretty lame.\n\nAnd the worst, I got Parmesan cheese for the pasta and I poured a little bit on top. It was like talk but that didn't bother me. However all of the sudden I started getting this weird smell. The cheese was stinky. Not like in a delish stinky French cheese, more like in a Whoeverbertos-sh@#hole-cleaning-table-cloth stinky. It reeked. Fortunately I didn't pour much so I was able to manage to eat the pasta but it was bad.\n\nI didn't even bother to tell them since I was so upset. \n\nAnyways, I'll go back for sure because the several other times I really enjoyed this place, but this was a bad experience. Plus $ 11 for soup and side pasta is not like super cheap.\n\nMy advise: Smell the cheese before pouring it in your food!\n\nOne more thing. The spoon was super old and bend :(","580732":"Yum yum yum. Sometimes you just need a good ol' sandwich. This is the place. They have amazing sandwiches that are great and delicious. I had the one with prosciutto (don't remember the name) and it was amazing. \n\nIt is also a cute little place to browse around and check out all the amazing Italian imports. Next time I try to go authentic Italian at home I will definitely be shopping here.","580778":"While I can't speak for the pizza (yet!), I have had two different pastas and sandwiches, both perfect and delicious. The larger portions of the pastas are LARGE. I am no light eater and that meal put me out like a light - although that may have been partially due to the fact that I was eating pasta :). The philly cheesesteak sandwich was excellent - probably one of the best I've had. \nThe store\/restaurant itself is very quaint - an Italian style grocery with a small amount of seating. The staff while kept busy is friendly and quick.\n\nOh, and the lemon bars. Do not leave here without a lemon bar.","580953":"Burnt crust!!  Went with grandkids and family twice.  One grandson loudly announced he liked Costco pizza better.\nTired tomato slices on $ 10 sandwich..\nSalads looked dried and old.\nThe crust of the pizza black.No dressing on sandwich\nAll staff very nice. Place was busy.\nWill visit again.  I have gone to De Falco's for 10 years.  I favor the combo.","581716":"Il Purista sandwich is a simple sandwich that packs big flavor.","581847":"I. Really. Like. This. Place!\n\nSo glad my friend suggested this place for lunch. It is a very authentic italia deli type place and also a market. I had a salad and it was so fresh, it tasted like I made it myself at home. I had some of the pasta salad my friend ordered and it was delivious. I wish I could have stayed to try more food but we had such a short lunch. I wonder if they have biscotti and italian espresso, because sitting on the paito was beautiful this time of year.","581905":"The food quality is great and they have many Italian options but the prices are a little steep. The dining area is small so you would not want to take a group here, but they do have options for some ingredients you would not find and other large grocery stores.","581908":"4 1\/2 stars!\n\nOh Defalco's.  You drain my bank account and you take up my entire lunch hour just driving to and from but I don't care, because you are delicious.  \n\nBy far the best authentic Italian deli in the Valley, I have yet to have one thing there that I didn't love.  They have a gigantic menu of options, featuring everything from hot and cold sandwiches, pizza, full hot pastas and entrees like the intoxicating chicken parmigiana, and a stacked deli case of side dishes with easily the best pasta salad I've ever had.  Family owned and operated which is another littler perk in my opinion.\n\nLet's put it this way.  My boss is usually in town for a week to a week and a half every month and he still manages to eat there at least 6 times...it's that good.\n\nThey freshly bake all of their own bread daily, which is excellent.  I prefer the Crispy Baguette with my sandwiches because it is oh so flaky and wonderful.\n\nIf you've got extra $$ to throw around they also have a quite nice-sized grocery selection right in the deli featuring authentic Italian delights.  I'm talking everything from 30 different types of aged balsamic vinagrette to over 100 different bottles of Italian wine.\n\nThe only reason I have to take a half a star off is because if you make the fatal mistake of going there between the hours of 11:30am-2:00pm M-F and you did not have the foresight to call your order in advance, you will sit there for 45 minutes, EASY.\n\nBut now that I have mastered the timed call in approach, it is wonderful and you should all go if you haven't : )","582089":"Ordered a chicken cheese steak sand and a portabella sand. So good went back the next day and ordered the beef cheese steak and YES the portabella sand. Will eat here with every future visit to Phoenix. Thanks DeFalcos","582238":"Unbelievably authentic and well priced.  I had the chicken parmesan sandwich- was delicious!  I cannot believe I've driven by this place for years and not stopped- absolutely loved it and am dying to stop by again.  This is the real deal.","582517":"Incredible & authentic gem. Hits the spot after getting scuba certified right next door.","583390":"Was in town for 2 weeks... it was the ONLY place I went more than once (3 times lol). There are no words... if you want authenticity, just go here... period. I want to live inside this shop, I couldn't get enough. I can't wait to visit again!","583552":"I ordered the eggplant parm sandwich and it was crispy and had just the right amount of sauce. They have tons of options to choose from for sandwiches, salads, pasta, and even dessert.","584300":"I ordered a meatball sub drove all the home and had the wrong sub.  Drive back to the restaurant and showed them the order and the girl yelled back to the kitchen and said you did it again and gave the wrong order out.  I didn't get an apology from anyone they just re made the order she gave it to me not showing me that it was the correct sandwich and said have a nice day.  The sandwich was ok I have had better meatball subs for a lot better price than the $14 I paid.","584495":"I have never had a thing here that wasn't amazing. The wait for your food is totally worth it and acceptable with their quality.","584684":"They had a large selection of cheeses and meats which was rather impressive though I was at work so didn't get the opportunity to purchase or try them. There was also an amazing selection of pastas to purchase, a lot of them were made in Italy and organic! A decent selection of Italian wines as well.\nI met for lunch! Such a great selection it took me a few minutes to decide. What I really liked about them is that they have half and whole portions and the sandwiches are properly priced!! The wait wasn't long either.\nThe blackberry jasmine iced tea I had was amazing!!! I ordered the Italian beef with the peppers and onions. The peppers were soft but very flavorful. The onions didn't have as much flavor and were a little overdone for my taste. The meat was great but sliced a bit too much for me (but each place does things differently) and there could have been a bit more on the sandwich. The au ju was great but not quite hot enough.\nOverall I will definitely be back to try other sandwiches, I just wasn't as thoroughly impressed as I expected.","584959":"Great cheese steak sandwich, and great pizza.  A kitchen that cooks with love.  Owner takes pride in the food, and clients. I'll be back.","584983":"This place is one of a kind for Arizona.   A great Italian deli with delicious sandwiches.   The sides are also amazing.   The place is also a very small market.  They have beer and wine to go.","585193":"Holy Cannoli  \n\nForget \"Defalco's,\" this biz is \"De-LICIOUS!\" Meatbal sub all day! Also, the CHEESECAKE is to die for! It's tiny inside but outside seating is available","585212":"As promised, I returned to DeFalco's Italian Grocery last week for another cheesesteak. I was offered a choice of either a crunchy or a soft roll, this time I opted for the soft roll. The frizzled beef was well seasoned and not greasy. The cheese was melted and mixed throughout, warm gooey goodness on a soft Italian roll which was reminiscent of a fresh Amoroso roll. I asked for hot sauce and was offered Tabasco. Once again, kudos to Anthony DeFalco for his willingness to incorporate customer feedback. That's truly as good as it gets!","586186":"This place does brisk business and for good reason. They have excellent food at massive portions (for the pastas).\n\nI waver between eggplant parmesan and chicken parmesan and I learned not too long ago that you can ask for double the bread instead of bread + a side salad. I mean, I'm getting Italian food and pasta - why have any shame about the amount of carbs I'm consuming?  Speaking of, for ~$10 for eggplant and maybe $12 for chicken parm, it provides at LEAST three meals for the whole size, and sometimes even 4 when I'm not too hungry. You truly cannot beat that- especially since it's always so delicious!\n\nThey have lots of stuff for purchase (hence the grocery name) but I've not purchased anything grocery-like except for ice cream. They have tons of drink options, including wine by the bottle for those taking out. Wines by the glass are surprisingly enjoyable for ~$6-$8 a glass (had the red blend and sauvignon blanc this visit).\n\nFor the deli items, they have pre-made deli salads, olives, and tons of cheeses at really good prices. They also have sausages but I'm personally not a fan (of sausage in general, so I've never had theirs).\n\nI like a locally-owned place, and this fits the bill, being super close to my house, very affordable and yummy. I've lived nearby for about a dozen or so years, and I feel like I see a few familiar faces when I visit which leads me to believe they treat their employees well also.\n\nMinus a star for\n- Using such potent\/pungent cleaning supplies in that bathroom that the stench wafts into the dining area, further limiting the amount of seating available (it's been REALLY bad on my last three visits)\n- Being super stingy with napkins for diners. Our table was dirty and rather than ask the busy employee to clean it, I wanted to self-service with a little water and not bother him - I was told that napkins come with the food.  Sure...that's fine, but when a patron asks for that to clean their own table, you either 1) get the napkins with no comment or 2) clean the table for them. To their credit, I was brought napkins promptly, but why aren't they out for messy people to grab as needed? I'm eating spaghetti for goodness' sakes!!","586466":"Bomb food  excellent sandwiches and great service. Nice little casual spot with awesome food. If you haven't tried this place you're missing out! Anytime is a good time for Defalco's! You won't regret it!","587637":"If you're in the mood for some good, but sloppy, Italian comfort food, Defalco's will do you good. They have pizza, pasta, salads and sandwiches, plus various desserts. I've only had a couple of their sandwiches and one of their salads. The sandwiches I've tried are the cheesesteak- bomb; the meatball - bomb; and the chicken parm - meh. I've tried their Chicken Spinach salad which was pretty good and filling. For dessert, try the Tiramisu which is pretty good - unfortunately, ours was still frozen but a couple minutes exposed was enough to be edible. Aside from the restaurant, Defalco's is also a mini Italian market where you can buy wines, bread and other Italian stuff. Be prepared to wait in line and for a table as it is a pretty small joint. All in all, this is a good place to go when you need a good sandwich.","587671":"Good but wasn't amazing, but we only had the calzones so I will try again! Centurion calzones was okay and I recreated a chicken parm calzone","588001":"Been coming to Dalfalcos for years and it never disappoints! If you are looking for speedy service you are probably not going to get it because they are busy making their food with sweet love! My go-to item is the Cheesesteak (better than any cheesesteak you will get in Philly.) The Mac and Cheese is out of this world, seriously the best I've ever had. Their homemade pastas and pizzas are super legit too. Not to mention they have a great Italian grocery selection. I like to grab their pre made pizza crust and toppings for pizza night at home. Did I mention they have amazing deserts too? Only downfall is you are immediately going to need to renew your gym membership once you leave.","588287":"After a couple of hit and misses on our meals in Scottsdale while here on a business trip we decided to take the advice of the manager at Old Town Cruisers where we went to rent bikes.And that was...come to Defalco's Deli. The sandwiches we had for for lunch were probably the best sandwiches we have ever had.Sadly we could eat only half because we were already enjoying our beautiful cappuccinos made by Antonio. The freshness of the food, the outstanding service and incredibly reasonable prices made this place the highpoint of our few days stay in Scottsdale. In fact we loved the joint so much we came back later that evening for dinner. We had the best calzone money can buy...my God it was good. My wife being a very versatile cook has made calzones and makes them very well but not as good as these guys. And then we shared a giant slice of New York cheesecake........no doubt the tastiest cheesecake we have ever had. We even took a tub of their imported gelato back to the hotel. It was a very unique flavor and I thought it was great. If we had known from day one how good this deli was we would have eaten here every day. As it is this is the only place we have dined at twice in the same day. Defalco's could just be the BEST DELI ON THE PLANET!","588322":"This place is super yummy!  It's literally a deli and grocery store, so don't expect much for ambiance or service.  But the food is excellent!  By the way, if you like a good mac and cheese, this place makes one of the best in all of greater Phoenix!","588933":"Amazing. I ordered the \"Maximus\" with a seafood pasta side salad and traditional cannoli. Awesome. This is on my list going forward. Taste buds are happy. Good selection of infused teas also. Love it!","589562":"This place is fantastic both for the quality of the food and the price.  Be prepared for a wait but it is well worth it.  You can do take out, phone orders or sit down.","589672":"Wonderful atmosphere. Great wine selection.definately recommended for sure. Loved the service. Great food.","590057":"Very disappointed for my first and last time coming here. The Spanish gentleman who took my order for 3 Philly cheesesteaks could not comprehend what cheese wiz was and just kept saying American. Then he took \"everything with provolone\" as a cheesesteak with all of their cheeses on it, lol. So after a 5 min long ordering process for 3 philly cheesesteaks speaking like a child to this guy due to his lack of english skills he finally got it right. I'm born and raised in Philadelphia so I know how to order a cheesesteak. As I sat and waited for my order, another gentleman came in and walked to the take out pick up counter in the front and asked the tall, thin, around 55 or so man working (he said he was one of the managers) if he could order one Philly cheesesteak, and the counter guy just pointed at the back and said \"you can't get a Philly cheesesteak but you can get a Phoenix cheesesteak.\" The guy trying to order was all confused and said I guess and proceeded to the back as the guy working the counter continued to say that he didn't want their sandwiches affiliated with Philadelphia cause its a horrible place with horrible people. So I kind of laughed and asked, wow, did you have a negative experience there or something. And he just said its a horrible place to go, and he feels bad for people who live in that \"hell hole.\" At this point I was getting offended and said hey man not all parts of Philly are bad, I'm born and raised there as well as my whole family and we turned out ok and love where we are from. He then told me I didn't know what I was talking about and that he wasn't changing his mind because it was the truth. I then realized his ignorant personality was not going to at least be open and talk like a normal person, so I called him an ignorant \"you know what\" and laughed at him for how bitter he was and said he should try shutting his mouth with his ignorant opinions openly in a deli that attracts many east coasters, perhaps others from Philly as well or others with family from that area. Thankfully, I did not think the cheesesteak was that good at all! Corleone's is much better for a cheesesteak so if your trying to get the authentic experience for a True Philly Cheesesteak, don't go here where they apparently hate Philadelphians anyways... There is no excuse for ignorant management. Not even an apology from his narrow minded self because he said out loud in front of a few people that everyone has the right to their own opinions. Now his opinions and sub par at best cheesesteaks are a reason I will trash talk this place to everyone I associate with here in the valley.","590587":"It's been atleast like 4 years since I have been here, maybe 3. But I recently passed it today and remembered how great this place is. I had a meatball sub. I think. I'm not positive but it was just amazing whatever I had. I can't wait to actually go back now that I remember this place. I recommend to everyone.","591819":"This place is fantastic. It looks like a deli that they put a bunch of italian groceries in and some italian baked goods. Its not a small place, but it feels small because there are so many shelves of groceries and not that many tables. Anyways, there was no line and ordering was very fast. They make you walk past the baked goods and deli meats before you get to the register to order, so look away if you know what you want and don't want to end up ordering extra baked goods and taking deli meat home! After you order, they give you a number and you find a place to sit. They will come out with your food and call the number when you are done. All-in-all, fast process.\n\nOn to the food! My girlfriend had the Gnocchi with Alfredo Sauce (you could also order it with a Pesto or a Red Sauce), I had a Lasagna and Half of an Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich, and we shared a Chocolate Cannoli. First off, the Gnocchi was the BEST I have ever eaten, which is saying a lot because my girlfriend orders Gnocchi EVERYWHERE we go that serves it. The texture of the Gnocchi was perfect; tender, but not too soft. The alfredo sauce on top absolutely completed the dish and complemented the little potato dumplings perfectly. I highly recommend the Gnocchi and Guarantee you won't be disappointed. The Lasagna was good, definitely above average, but it was missing my favorite part of Lasagna, those delicious burnt edges. The Eggplant Parmigiana sandwich was good, but the breading on the Eggplant Parmigiana didn't have any crunch to it. I know that Parmigiana isn't supposed to have a lot of crunch, but I just wanted a little. The Cannoli was awesome. The shell was dipped in chocolate (you don't have to get it this way) and stuffed with the classic ricotta cheese-based mixture, which I think had some chocolate shavings in it. If you like cannolis, definitely give them a try here. \n\nIn conclusion, I will be back, and I will have to try a cheesesteak, because they are supposed to be legendary and that seemed to be what 75% of people came in for.","593645":"Enoyes the Cesar grilled chicken salad. Very tasteful as well the garlic butter bread. I am a very picking eater, can definitely see myself eating there again. On another note I thought it was interesting on how you order your own food","594634":"This place is amazing.  I'm sure you have had Italian food like me from several supposedly Italian restaurants and the food is mediocre at best.  Well that is not the case with Defalco's.  It's is the real deal.  I ordered a calzone which you pick the toppings from the pizza menu... so the options are vast.  I spotted the cheese cake and ordered a slice of strawberry and thought I was done.  Now the wait begins.  Defalco's isn't warming up your frozen calzone so ya...you have to wait while they stuff that calzone with all of the toppings you selected.  Trust me the wait it is worth every second!  During this time I'm walking around looking at the bread and drinks I notice the sandwiches being delivered again and again and again.  Each whole sandwich looking better than the last and they keep coming!  I couldn't take it anymore.  I got back into the line and ordered the epic \"Maximus\".  Again you pick what you want they don't assume anything which the term Made your way truly means something.  The prices are great for the portion and quality of food. My order came out Calzone and cheese cake first.  My sandwich was being made so I had to wait a little bit longer.  Again nothing pre-made here so chill while they create your master piece.  I was approached several times asking if I needed anything.  The staff is very friendly a bit confused why I was waiting since I was holding my order.  The staff and I had a laugh as I explained while waiting And seeing the sandwich's I had to order one.  I get my sandwich and head back to the hotel.  I arrive the calzone is still hot. This is an indicator it truly was fresh out of the over.  I started to dig in and WOW.  The red sauce and calzone ...amazing, cheese cake is tasty, and the sandwich ....well.. you will never want to order a sandwich from anywhere else again.  5 star because there is absolutely nothing I could find the least be disappointing.  Don't mind the pics in bad lighting.","595996":"The One, the Only.\n\nMy eyes almost welled over when I first bit into their lasagne.  For seven long years I went all over the Valley looking for an Italian joint that could serve up a plate of Nonna's finest with no nonsense and no pretense.  I found a few that were the real deal, but nothing of this level.  Defalco's truly is an oasis of Italian dining in the desert.  Fresh imported meats and cheeses and old country finesse in the kitchen have finally given me the masterpieces of flavor that I have been looking for.\n\nThis ain't a fancy place that makes you feel like you should be wearing a tie.  You go up to the counter, you order, and you sit next to the racks of Italian groceries to eat your meal.  Forget the diet, okay?  You have your pasta, your salad, and some garlic bread, and the world is a better place.  They also have sandwiches, pizza, and delicious desserts.\n\nAll right, that's it, time to go back--there's so much on the menu to try.","596842":"The food is delicious but the owner is a jerk. Went in to get some food and he was talking under his breath. My boyfriend then asked is something wrong but he continued with an attitude and talking under his breath saying obscene remarks we then left with him begging us to come back. It's too bad because the food is delicious but I will not go back no matter how good the food is.","596962":"Now, when I finally digested the meal, holly-Molly it was amazing! Our pastas, gnocchi and backed ziti were delicious. On top of that, we have scored two free deserts curtesy of an an awesome kitchen personnel because my friend's order too way too long after mine came out. Thanks, to this guy at Defalco's. Watch me getting bigger and bigger, people, because I found my happy place\nP.s. the line is disorganized because there are three different registers on the way\u200d","597370":"I'd been hearing about Defalco's for a while now. My husband, Jim W, and my youngest, Abby, raved. \"Best steak grinda since Baston,\" they said. So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed \"Boston\" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.\n\nSo we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.\n\nThe food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.\n\nWhat's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving.","597634":"Wasent impressed at all with the service or the food !! First time here my little sister brought me I had the sausage sandwich and when they brought it to the table it was cold the sausage was good though!! We ordered drinks and they came after our food did which was odd !! We were hot and thirsty and wanted our drinks !! The service was really slow  and it just seemed like nobody wanted to be there !!  I'll give this place another shot and maybe next time  it will be different !! We will see that's why I gave it 2 stars","597772":"One word: YUM. I have had a few different pastas and a few different sandwiches- all are amazing! The place is always busy- I recommend calling ahead and placing your order so you can pick it up and go on your way! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and they sell a bunch of Italian groceries","599098":"I love Defalco's and have been going there for years. The only issue I have is when I order Togo their is alway something wrong or missing.","599239":"I have heard exciting and molto delicioso things DeFalco's. See, ever since I took a trip to Tuscany a few years ago, I am always faced with yearning for the freshest prosciutto, the perfect cheese and bread, and a wine to wash down the salty, meaty goodness with. E ecco!\n\n I ambled in and was awash in Italian grocery goodness. The giant gallon-sized cans of Extra Virgin Olive Oil with the Italia stamp on it made me long for the olive gardens of yesteryear, the truffled gelato in the freezer was whispering sweet nothings to me... I had to hold myself back fiercely to not grab a basket and start purchasing everything. \n\nI stood in line patiently-- it was mid-afternoon on a Saturday and there was quite a bit of traffic. While I waited, I stared in the refrigerated glass counter at the stuffed mozzarella balls, the various Italian salads and fresh-cut meats. I moved closer and laid my eyes on the menu. There she was: \"Il Purista,\" the greatest-sounding sandwich ever: Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Tomato, Roasted Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Balsamic Vinegar. Che fortunato! I ordered it from the surly Italian guy behind the counter. The sandwich was the perfect combination of flavors, but what was most impressive was the pile of prosciutto on it. I could not believe the quantity, quality and savory goodness. My mouth waters just thinking about it.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that I had to wander around their close quarters for about a half an hour before I got my food, I think I will call ahead next time. They do have a sign that warns you about their process taking longer than usual, so I consider myself warned and cannot wait to sink my teeth into their food again soon!","600176":"Absolutely the best lasagna ever! Twenty year customer and now return every October. Great staff, wonderful food and extras in the shopping area-family owned business too.","600601":"Great place! Love their Deli! They have a great selection of wine and amazing food!","602436":"Defalcos! YES PLEASE! Invite me here anytime and I will say YES and then I will eat EVERYTHING all the time! \n\nThis place, unfortunately, is right next to the dive shop we have been visiting regularly... which means I fortunately get to have an excuse to drive from Gilbert and devour anything made by Defalcos that I can think of. \n\nWe have been here numerous times as I used to live nearby for college and it was a favorite among the four of us who lived together. Plus, I don't think anyone has ever been disappointed with what they ordered. There is a wide variety of Italian options on the menu and everything appears to be fresh made in house and served up hot and delicious. My favorites have been the chicken pesto pizza (the larger the better), the lasagna, and anything desert. \n\nEverything you order is HUGE plus it comes with garlic bread, a salad, really it's the whole Italian works. \n\nReally... you will not be disappointed here with what you order. This place is also like an Italian market so they have all sorts of pastas, sauce, oils, desserts, everything Italian that you can buy and take home to make on your own. \n\nJUST. DO. IT! You may be sad afterwards... but it's only cause you realized you couldn't help yourself from eating way to much delicious food.","604130":"If you are looking for top notch food- this is it. If you want atmosphere and a restaurant experience- not for you. All fresh ingredients and really outstanding flavors. Meatball Sandwich, cheese pizza, antipasto salad all very flavorful","604332":"I heart Defalcos. The sandwhiches are always good and yesterday I had a bite of a friends pasta and it was delish.  I have also purchased things from the store and they are always amazing. Four stars only because sometimes the wait is ridiculous.","606017":"Its a small store and deli packed with italian stuff.  Large selection of pasta and sauces as well as desert makings.  We went for lunch to the deli.  I must admit, one of the best cheese steaks I've ever had.  Its a shame we live so far away from here, I'd definitely frequent this place.","606117":"What a great place!  It's a market... no, it's a deli... no, it's a bakery... no, it's a restaurant.  Hmmm... nope, it is ALL of those things!  And the food?  Spectacular!  \n\nI have only tried a chocolate shell cannoli and a sandwich that I forget the name of (it had prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, tomato, fresh basil, and handful of other deliciousness on it)... but Defalco's is one of those places where you just know they know what they're doing!\n\nI'm super-excited that I found this gem and cannot wait to get back over to Scottsdale to stop here again!  Bravissimo!","607581":"If there's a better deli I sure don't know what it would be!  The imported meats are amazing, and the italian dishes like lasagna and pizza are also excellent.  You can't go wrong here...unless it's lunchtime and you're in a rush.  In that case, don't come here! :)","607674":"Finding real Italian food in Arizona is an uphill battle, I wanted a grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli rabe and roasted garlic and the people behind the counter looked at me like I was nuts.. No broccoli rabe and no roasted garlic. I've had better Italian food at Irish joints and probably would have fared better at Olive Garden","608062":"I've never had anything that wasn't absolutly delicious! Great Italian food and if you are in the mood to cook, they have it all for a perfect Italian meal! Try the take out to impress your next dinner party!!","609759":"Being from NY I had high expectations of this place. I was disappointed though. My eggplant sandwich was okay. Kind of tasteless. I wasnt thrilled with the cookies either. I saw pictures online of rice balls in the case under the counter where all prepared food is but there were none so I asked for one. They said they had them in the back. I said I wanted it \"to go\" & I waited and waited. I finally asked if perhaps they were heating it up because it wasnt necessary to do so. I was told it was \"frozen\" & they popped it in the oven. Wha? Frozen? Why not fresh? Why make rice balls & freeze them? Turn off. I didnt find the guy behind the counter to be too friendly either. Another worker was irritating because he sat in the corner eating and staring at me to the point of being so blatently rude my husband felt the need to block his view. C'mon, get it together.","609829":"This is the real deal. As a person of Italian decent, this is about as close to authentic home made your going to find in the Scottsdale area.  Had one of their eggplant parm subs. Nothing but excellent. Also had an order of cured Italian olives.  This is a grocery\/deli, so you are surrounded by all types of delicacies. This is worth a stop.","610422":"We were so excited about this place because we've heard such good things! Service was ok. Spaghetti sauce tasted a lot like chef boyardee canned sauce which was disappointing. Also had no gluten free options so ended up with tuna salad.","610453":"The chicken fettuccini Alfredo is delicious! The old fashion spaghetti with meatball, also on point. This is one of those market\/deli\/restaurants that are worth the awkward set up. The chicken in the Alfredo is breaded. Even though that is not my preference and I wasn't expecting it, it was still some of the best Alfredo that I've ever had. In fact, the only restaurant that has an Alfredo that is worth going out for(since carussos in Gilbert closed down years and years ago, which had the best Chilean sea bass, that I've ever had, but that's a whole other story... miss them but feeling hopeful since finding this place). They put Parmesan cheese on the caeser salad, which makes the cheese factor farther than my preference but for you parm lovers, you have that to look forward to. \nThe dessert shelves look phenomenal but we are awfully full... so glad to have a new favorite Italian place. It's harder to do than I thought it would be so I'm super excited.","611483":"Wow! They do not disappoint. Asked for a little unique spin on traditional pasta, sooo fresh, soo tasty. Great authentic italian grocer & restaurant in the middle of town. Definitely stop by & try the fresh pasta, pizza or sandwiches","612034":"Having visited this place over the years I've had a chance to sample much of the menu including pasta dishes, salads, sandwiches, and desserts and have had only one dish that I'd rate I'd rate under a 5.  The Philly cheesesteak is made with grilled rib eye and hands down the best cheesesteak I've ever had.  Most menu items can be ordered full or half, if you have a way to store the food for your next meal, for a nominal increase in cost it's two meals for a few dollars more.","612907":"This is one of the best lunch places in the entire city. The whole menu is incredible.  There are fantastic buys in the deli\/grocer area if you so choose.","613202":"Hands down one of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had. It's definitely authentic as well. I ordered half sizes of two dishes and the portions are extremely big, but who doesn't like leftovers","613326":"This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. \n\nThe first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.\n\nDefalco's has a very \"Back East\" feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and fresh cold pasta counters.\n\nCheck 'em out you won't be disappointed!","614939":"We were here couple of times with my work friends and team. It is a really nice place for quick lunches, though cramped up some times. They offer great selection of authentic Italian food and groceries as well. If you are an Italian food lover like me then try this place.","615356":"So I have not been here for lunch in probably 8 years as we usually get the pizza for dinner and was just reminded of how AMAZING my favorite sandwich is! It is honestly heaven. I order the Mozzarella, Tomato, and Basil (Cold Sandwich) + Prosciutto. The bread has the perfect crunch, the oil and vinegar are authentic, and the prosciutto is some of the best in the Valley. If you love Caprese, this sandwich IS your jam, I promise! I will be back wayyyy more often for lunch thanks to this fabulous reminder! Thank you for ALWAYS impressing, Defalco's!","616277":"I grew up in Scottsdale and would come into Defalco's from time to time and always LOVED it (I even remember when they were at there old location). I moved from AZ a little over a year and a half ago and in the months leading up to the move I found myself eating there more and more. It's one of the few restaurants in AZ I truly miss. Anyways, I was recently in AZ visiting for about eight days and I ate here THREE times during that span. \n\nFor as often as I've eaten here over the years I've only tried about 4 or 5 things on the menu (why fix what ain't broken). The four-meat sandwich is AWESOME as is the Italian sausage sandwich. Get a whole, and you have a meal for now, and one for later. On my recent visit these are the two things I had (yep, I did the four-meat sandwich twice). Other dishes I can remember trying over the years are the antipasti, which is loaded with goodies as well as the ravioli, which are delicious (usually I'm not a fan of the sauce at little takeout Italian places like this, but Defalco's sauce is very good). \n\nIn the past I've gotten takeout, but on this last trip I ate there all three times (there's not a ton of seating, but it seems like most people get takeout). It takes a little while to get your food (if you're not eating there I'd call in your order), but you can't rush good food :) For the quality and portion size the prices here are very reasonable. \n\nI'm not much of a cook, so I've never really taken advantage of the \"market.\" However, there seems to be a lot of items you won't find in the supermarket, so I'm sure if you like to cook Italian food and are looking for specialty items, this might be the place for you.","616860":"Well I was in Scottsdale for a business trip and saw this hole in the wall deli \/ Italian grocery and thought I would give it a shot.  I thought it would just be sandwiches, but this place is an Italian restaurant with a deli \/ grocery store front!  The Veal Parm was awesome!  I came back the next day to try the famous cheesesteak and it was incredible as well.  I do admit the cheese was kind of strange because it was melted into liquid consistency, but the taste was awesome!  If I had another day I would have tried the pizza because it looked just as spectacular.  \nI also got a chance to speak with the owner and he was really cool.  The wait there is a little much, but when you are ordering food like this you have to certainly expect a wait, and there is a sign on the door warning customers of this, so it should be no surprise.  Some reviewers complain about the prices but for food of this quality it is really a bargain!  This place is the real deal, I highly recommend it!","617228":"Sadly we have not had the same positive experience as others. During our last visit, we ordered at the counter. We sat down and waited forever for our food. The Eggplant Parmesan was dismal, gray, spongy, flavorless, cold and dry. The cheese was a solid, hard mess -- like a bad leftover. (Huh, usually leftover Italian food is even better the next day!) It was thickly layered, more like lasagna than eggplant parm. The garlic bread was disappointing, also soggy and flavorless. It should be nicely toasted with Italian spices and redolent with garlic. It wasn't. The meatball sandwich was the same. Tables are scarce at dinner and lines are long. It wasn't worth the wait for us. We've crossed Defalco's off our list of go-to local places. We prefer Uncle Sal's, a little more expensive but spacious and with a great flavors, expansive menu and good service. (Make reservations, especially when the snowbirds are here.)","619470":"My God, the bread.  Sooo amazing.  I've had a meatball sandwich and a cheesesteak from here so far and they were killer.\n\nThe cheesesteak just drips out cheese and everything is so fresh.  Quality is key here, seriously.  Also getting the full sized sandwich is ridiculously filling, definitely get your moneys worth.","619778":"Wow....give me on the meat and juices!! \n\nHave had several sandwiches here, and they're all amazing. \n\nService is fine, and the wait can be long. Sometimes there is no seating inside, but we generally take it back to the office.","619806":"I love this Italian deli. The reviews and ratings didn't prove me wrong at all. Me and my colleague went there during our office lunch. We had mozzarella, tomato and basil on focaccia and Multi grain bread. The mozzarella was so fresh and so damn soft! Wow! For dessert we chose tiramisu and chocolate Cannoli. The tiramisu was exceptional. By far, this is the best tiramisu I had in Arizona. I would definitely visit this place again for pastas and lasagnas of course. They had decent amount of seating indoors and outdoors. I will go to this place again and again and again!","620277":"This place is FANTASTIC ! I just spent 5 day's in AZ. My father suggested Defalco's after we had been to a couple of places that were over priced, bad food, unfriendly staff's. Defalco's was 5 star on all of these . We ended up there every night while I was there. Hey guy' do Denver a favor and open a place up here! We are in desperate need of a place and people like you! Thanks for the great food and all around relaxing experience and as an \"ex\" pizza place owner myself terrific staff! What a find!","620620":"Meatball sub is the best ya too go. Very filling. Little boring with the flavors. But good deal at lunch. Cute little Italian grocery store to pick up some authentic Italian goodies","622041":"Great food.   Like being back in Brooklyn.   \"Leave the gun, take the Cannolis\".  Line from the Godfather.   Seriously, get the cannolis","622217":"This review is based on just food.\n\nI have no idea why people rave about this place. Ill go piece by piece.\n\nCounter style ordering doesn't really bother me, and the guy taking my order was super cool. The behind him though, kind of a jerk and kept bitching about getting in late orders. It was close to closing probably 45 minutes out, I wasn't at the 30 minute mark so I think i was good. I walked in and then 20 others walked in behind me, obviously DeFalcos is no stranger to later diners.\n\nOrdered chicken parm and mac and cheese. The chicken cutlet itself was absolutely nothing to call home about. It was pounded out, breaded and friend appropriately, nothing special at all. The pasta was way over cooked, and the red sauce, was watered down and lacked any depth or flavor. Ive cooked, and eaten both American Italian and traditional Italian my entire life and this sauce fell very short of what I expected. It wasn't like it was a quick crushed tomato, garlic, red pepper, onion, basil sauce that you through together on Tuesday. It was an I spent all day making this sauce, let me dump some water into it. \n\nMac and cheese, same deal. Noodles were overcooked, the mornay was a joke. Literally watered down and tasted like nothing. I tried to taste it, it literally tasted like nothing. I put some salt and pepper on it, it tasted like nothing and salt and pepper. \n\nFinally the garlic bread. It was good, extremely reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread. Not being rude here it just was reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread. I regret having to write this, i thought everyone was spot on about this place but it was not good at all. \nMy $0.02.","624284":"Wow! I stocked up on peppers, flour to make pasta, wine, and ladyfingers for tiramisu and had an amazing lunch. We shared a meatball and a sausage sandwich and I can't decide which one I like better. And the price...So reasonable. Our bill for the 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks was just under $20. What a price! and we had more food than we could eat. The deli section looks amazing and I can't wait to get some meats for home from here soon. They have a fantastic selection of products. We had to go back and get cannoli's for later and we just had them tonight and they were some of the best I have had and the most reasonable. Another place has some very similar and charges double the price they charged. I am very impressed with this place and am just sad it took me so long to get here and try it. I already have stuff picked out to try on my next trip!","624894":"Whether you are eating in or taking out, food is so amazing and authentic it's a must have.\n\nBy far one of the best Italian eateries in town.","625235":"We have been going here for years! Since the wait can be a little long at the restaurant we usually order takeout and it's ready within twenty min! The chicken Parmesan is delicious - the meal includes a side salad and garlic bread for about $11, can't beat it! I also love their veggie americano sandwich - the sub roll is super good and always fresh! Sometimes the staff can be a little rude but I think it's just because they're always busy, but I don't like feeling rushed when ordering and at times they can be impatient. Overall a wonderful place!","626114":"If you're looking for 'authentic' Italian food this is the place. The guys behind the counter had that deep Italian twang to their voice that you see in the movies! \n\nThe building is an Italian Grocery with imported (albeit expensive - - 5.29 for the box of crackers I saw, they must be basted with Olive Oil by Mama Celeste!) foods everywhere.\n\nYou order from a little counter in the back, and you can choose from pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches among other things. \n\nI had half a grilled portobello sandwich, and half of the Cappacolo and Provolone. \n\nThe portobello was meaty and came with a thick red pepper covered in their homemade pesto. The Cappacolo was the star of the meal, however. Thin slices stacked high with some of the best tomatoes I've ever had in Arizona. \n\nIt's pretty inexpensive too, spending more than 10 bucks a person would leave you with a belly bursting.","626175":"Food is good, but the service is horrible.  Trying to order today, they were not busy, I was the only person in line and it took 10 minutes, largely due to the fact the counter person abruptly left and took several minutes to come back.  Did apologize, but the person that followed him out was obviously upset with a customer and stated so, loudly.  We've been there quite a few time, but to be honest, there are other delis just as good with service and employees who appreciate you coming in .","626219":"A coworker and I checked the place out for the first time a few weeks ago.\n\nI liked the atmosphere. It seemed more of a grocery store with a few tables than a restaurant, but that's not a complaint. The chicken parmesan sandwich was awesome! I can't wait to try the pizza. And, I'd like to go there for one of their Italian beers, as well.\n\nThe grocery part was awesome. They had a good selection of pasta, sauces, cheeses, etc. \n\nCall ahead your order! Especially if you have a time limit. Otherwise, great place that is a must to check out.","626273":"When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant\/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  \n\nFirst off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  \n\nMy fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.\n\nIt certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!","626357":"They Have No Guanciale!!! I know most people don't know\/care what it is, but that's why I went there. (BTW it's jowl bacon that's been seasoned and cured, it's good stuff, and the ONLY way to make legit carbonara. IMO it makes a big difference. FYI they don't have carbonara on the menu.)\n\nHad the baked ziti, it was good, not amazing, but good. It's a minor complaint but the garlic bread was not particularly good, it was almost stale you could tell it was made a few hours before. Nor was the bread crispy or toasty, it was meh. The salad was OK, had a jalape\u00f1o; why? I don't know. But like I said the baked ziti was good.\n\nI would go again but I would order a calzone.","626400":"No ambience but great food, particularly the sandwiches. After one bite, you will think you are in the Taj Mahal.","627099":"I feel pretty lucky to have found this place. As a recent Chicago transplant I had low expectations but must say this place does it right. Huge menu, lots of great choices.\nI have only had a few of the sandwiches so far and they have both been delicious. The cheesesteak and the chicken parm.\nCan't wait to go back and try more! \nIf they start baking porchetta I might move in.","627563":"Believe the hype! This place is very very good. I love the market aspect, if I ever need something specialized for an Italian dish I'm making I'm definitely coming here.\n\nI've been here a couple times to get some pasta, I've had the gnocchi and the baked ziti. For the price that you're paying this place is top notch.\n\nDuring lunch it gets very busy because people love this spot, but there is a good amount of seating available.","628026":"Could someone please explain to me how a so-called Italian deli can in good conscience use Boars Head meats?  Give me a break.  At least get some Molinari instead.  No good self-respecting Italian deli would use Boars Head.","628280":"Great place for casual Italian dining. Sandwiches, salad, entrees, and even a glass of wine or a beer to round out your meal. Top it off with an espresso and a pastry, and you're really living... Salute!","628436":"Hands down best Alfredo and philly cheesesteak. Usually write pros and cons but there's no doubt the food here is bomb! Take all my out of state friends here just to try their food.","628711":"This place is dope on a rope! The desserts are amazing, the sandwiches are amazing the pizza is amazing and the people are amazing! The smell is recognizable while driving and is definitely a favorite of mine!","628836":"I was scrolling through yelp food recomendations and saw this place. I love places that you can buy imported specialties. This ensures at least that the ingridients in the deli are authentic. I picked the reuben and my boyfriend picked the prosciutto. Both were on fresh bread that had wonderful texture. I choose to have the corn beef on my reuben and it was cooked perfectly. It reminded me of home. \nI also purchased there lemon bar which was cooked well and tasted fresh. Had the right amount of lemon flavoring without being overwhelming.\n\nWe arrived at 7 pm and they seemed busy. I was slightly confused on where to order but I also believe I misunderstood the signs directing the customer. At the end as we were leaving we were handed a loaf of bread for free. It made my day!\n\nI will definitely be returning again and will test out different times to guage the best times to go!","630103":"I love this place. It brings me right back to NY with the hustle and bustle of the Italian delis there. There is always a wait around meal times so be prepared. But the food is totally worth it.","631137":"Honest to god the best beef cheese steak in America.  Philly has nothing on DeFalco's.  \n\nSuperb chicken caesar pasta salad.  \n\nFriendly, competent staff. \n\nGreat grocery.\n\nAll three color Chimay beers for sale.\n\nGnocchi is excellent.","631161":"Amazing food! It is always busy because it is so good. They try to get everyones order at a timely manner. The pasta is my favorite along with the pasta salad. I will keep going on my lunch breaks!","631847":"The food is always very good, and freshly made.  The wait can be long at times (because everyone knows they can go here for good, affordable grub).  The staff is very friendly.  And they have a grocery (expensive, though).\n\nThere is outside seating, right next to Scottsdale Road (very romantic).  Inside the seating is very close and near the grocery shelves.  We usually take it to go, unless we're with friends we don't want to bring into our home.  Just kidding.\n\nDon't order the Reuben.  It's not good.  Everything else we've tried is though.","632446":"I am eating my meatball sub, made with the finest Italian sauces and tenderized meat, but I then receive a call - a call that will change my life; I receive call that Tommy just got whacked in retribution for taking out Battis. But then I blink, I am back to reality eating my sub and listening to my friend asking how in the world Phoenix has traffic. \n\nI am mixing up life stories, I had the meatball sub, and I've seen Goodfellas, so they are blending into one another.\n\nDefalco's is great. I swear, from sea to shining sea, I never expected to find a place that would make me want to watch Casino and Goodfellas while eating something Italian. But AZ is a place of continuous surprises. \n\nThis place is half grocery store, half restaurant. Much of your experience will depend when you go here. The food is always delectable. Man, I am talking you could probably bring all of the mafia families down to a table to break bread and work out their differences over it good. But again, it depends on the time.\n\nI gave Defalco's four stars and it was as hard as pulling an in-grown toenail. I do really enjoy this place, but there are some things you can't overlook. They have great foods and a wide selection of groceries to choose from, but it's quite small. Everyone is in love with this place so there are limited number of seats to choose from. \n\nAnd the line situation is never clear. It's like Southwest Airlines where they have you line up according to your zone and seats, but people think because they are B13, that entitles them to run roughshoud over B14 and be rude. To avoid this - go at a non-busy time, but I am not sure when that is. Trial and error.\n\nI recommend going here. It's finger licking good. I am not an Italian, so I can't speak for their cuisine, but I think it would make them proud.","633561":"The first time I went here I loved it. Every time since it's been worse. Slowest staff I've ever seen. There was no line and it took me 36 minutes to get them to cut me some deli meat. The tall Italian guy acts like it's a problem to help you. This place is going downhill. I ordered a meatball sub the other day and it came out cold.","634581":"Defalco's has an excellent variety of sandwiches and salads all rolled up into a cozy little Italian grocery. While the shopping selection is nice (according to my wife) the food borders on fantastic! \n\nSeriously, even the greatest carnivores among us (like me) that normally scoff at a vegetarian entree will buckle for the the mighty Defalco's mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar on sub roll. \n\nThe service is friendly but the shop can get extremely crowded during peak feeding frenzies. Try to go early or slightly late if possible, you won't be disappointed.","635611":"what a great place - stopped in for some carryout for a picnic lunch with a friend at Papago Park; it took a long time to decide what to get, it all looked so good.  Everything was delicious.","636336":"My first trip here was with coworkers excited to take me out for lunch because I had never heard of the place. I've been in Az a very long time since leaving the NY area so I was sure if there was an amazing Italian Deli I would know about it by now. After lunch here I was prepared to eat crow and the entire menu.\n\nThis place reminds me of my childhood on the East Coast, picking up supplies for dinner and getting a quick eggplant parm for lunch. They've got a great selection of meats, antipasto bar, pastas, oils and cheeses. The only thing that's missing is fresh pasta for sale (they do have pizza dough). They also get very busy but you can call orders in ahead of time.\n\nOn to the sandwiches, I've had the egg salad, eggplant parm and Italian beef with au jus. While I like egg salad definitely stick with Italian fare, they know what they're doing. My husband is a big fan of the sausage and peppers. \n\nI can say that we've been there many times since and plan to be long time customers. Any slight issues we've had with wait times or service is more than made up for by that eggplant.","636627":"The food was great and the service was awesome. They have a great selection of items to buy.","637541":"This review concerns the sandwiches only.\n\nI really like their food except for... the bread (which is kind of ironique for a sandwich).\n\nThe breads are way too soft (even the crunchy one which is not crunchy at all). \n\nBeing from France, I love bread but there is nothing like european bread in that shop. Other than the bread it is really good. That's why i usually buy my own bread somewhere else and when i get a sandwich at Defalco, i just put all of the ingredients from their sandwich into my own piece of bread.","637627":"I'm in love! We ordered The \"Centurion\" pizza and lasagna - brought it all home, cracked open a bottle of Italian wine and oh.my.goodness.  The pizza was FANTASTIC and the lasagna wasn't too shabby either!  The store itself carries some unique items - imports - that I haven't seen at other specialty stores in the area.  Defalco's is absolutely worth a stop - check it out!","638308":"I came on a Sunday, there was really no one here, and it was my first time here, so I asked the person behind the counter, what's your specialty, what's good?  He said, \"pb&j sandwich but its not on the menu.\"  I didn't know whether he was serious or just trying to be sarcastic, so I laughed took the higher road. He didn't really offer anything and his answer was a little rude - my friend said it was really rude.  I ended up having the sandwich combo and my friend had the meatball sandwich, neither was remarkable nor noteworthy, they were just average. So not sure what the big deal with this place is? I have to wait and watch triple d to see if they recommend something better.","638342":"Love love love this place . Shout out to Jasmine or J something girl with glasses and braces and a very pretty smile and friendly customer service driven demeanor . They rock and replaced a sandwich they slightly messed up no questions asked . Customer forLYFE!","638659":"Legit Italian deli with a great selection of wine, snacks, food, and desserts. Il Purista is what I order every time, and sometimes a cannoli on the side. Have a drink with your meal!","638823":"After reading the reviews about how great the cheese steak sandwich is we decided to try Defalco's and absolutely loved it! We have tried several places in Phoenix and have not found one we have liked until now! We will definitely be back.","639917":"1st off, the food is awesome. DeFalco's does not disappoint on that note. They are on point. The fresh moz is stellar, just salty enough. The sandwiches are fantastic. Their deli meat selection is perfect. I would have given them 5 stars was it not for the recent service I have gotten. If you get Anthony or Joe it is awesome service. If you get the muscular guy in the hat it will not be. A lesson in \"ownership mentality\" would be a good thing for him. Your customers are the most important thing, serving friends (girlfriends..) in front of other customers already in line is a bad idea. Then rushing them when they are ordering deli meat with THEIR children present and asking them \"is that it\", \"is that it\", in a condescending way is not a wise choice. Having said that, I will continue to come back to Defalco's as their food and Anthony make it the best Italian deli in Arizona.","639984":"I was introduced to Deflaco's Italian Grocery last summer and I can't believe I had made it so long, living right down the street without ever stopping in! While I've never purchased anything from the grocery or deli, they do have a ton of traditional Italian products for sale. Everything you'd need to prepare a delicious Italian feast! \n\nWhat I go there for are the sandwiches. I'm a HUGE fan of their tuna sandwiches. I order them with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pepperoncinis. I also LOVE the macaroni pasta salad, but only get that if I can restrict myself to half of a tuna sandwich. I've had the egg salad before, and while it's an acceptable alternative when they're out of tuna, I only order it when I can't get my fav. They've got a pretty decent beer selection too which is great if you're stopping in on a Sunday afternoon and would like an \"adult beverage\" with your meal. \n\nI've not yet tried their pizza or pasta, but will be sure to post an update once I do. It always looks and smells delicious!","640168":"Wow!! This place is seriously a gem. Our family has been coming here for several years now and we've decided that this is the closest you can get to an authentic Italian deli in the East Valley. \n\nMy recommendation is the \"Il Purista\" sandwich--a basic Italian sub with prosciutto, basil, tomato, fresh mozzarella, etc. This sandwich is a game changer. The price is extremely fair and the size of the sandwich is perfect for leftovers. \n\nService is good and they always have call in orders done on time. \n\nSeriously-don't miss this place.","640350":"Awesome deli!  had the Li purista....super good, tons of prosciutto and banging flavor!\n\nWe will be back!","640684":"Love it.  We stop for lunch every time we are in town.  Awesome fresh bread and all the Italian classics.","642778":"Good, but way too busy and not enough tables to enjoy lunch. If you don't mind standing in a long line to order, standing around waiting for it, and eating at a dirty table if you're lucky enough to get one, this is a true Italian deli.","642851":"Living n the FAR West Valley means that I only get on this side of town once or twice a year. We stopped in after picking up my nephew from the airport because I wanted to see if they had John's Ravioli CO Inc products in the market area. They did and I was so happy that I bought 2 packages of the meat ravioli's . \n\nNear I-17 there are two stores that carry  them but they are old inventory all the time and always freezer-burnt. These were not and we cooked them up and ate them with my famous Alfredo sauce-YUM!\n\nWe will be back for more ravioli's and for the sandwiches too :)","642862":"This review is for their catering - wow, they made me look good.  I had them put together an antipasto tray (pasta salad, marinated artichokes and mushrooms, olives and pepperoncinis) and an \"italian style\" (pepperoni, capacollo, genoa salami, provolone & muenster cheese), plus some of their rolls that they were nice enough to slice into smaller portions.  To say the amount of food on each tray was abundant would be a huge understatement.  They were literally overflowing and needed two of us to carry each of them.  Unfortunately, the plastic trays they used couldn't handle all that weight, so the lids wouldn't stay on and we had to very carefully move them so they didn't collapse. There must've been 10 pounds of bread.   Every single item on all the trays was of the highest quality.  You could tell the trays were made fresh that day.  The bread was amazing - soft on the inside and just chewy enough on the outside.  Too bad they don't have a fork-free dessert option, because I would have loaded up on that too.  Everyone ate more than they intended and we got lots of oohs and aahs.  Best part of it all is that there were enough leftovers for us to enjoy for several days!","642946":"My love affair with DeFalco's continues. There was 6 of us there last night,including my elderly parents,and my sister from Montreal. I had to take her there so she can experience what my wife,myself and my daughters have experienced in the past. Perfection!!\n\nWe got there earlier than usual because of when my parents eat dinner and it was great timing before the Friday night crowd came. My sister loved DeFalco's and was so mesmerized with all their items,including the wines and Imported items that you can't find in most places.\n\nI had to have their Pizza Bianca White Pizza), which as usual was delicious. My wife has their Chicken Parmigiana, my Dad had Spaghetti and Meatballs (incredible), my sister and my Mom had the Eggplant Parm, and my daughter had the Chicken Fettuccine. Of course we all tried each others and all were amazing. Oh,I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Ball to share and dip in sauce. Every dish was amazing. \n\nMy family are originally from NY and ate some great food there, and I am so grateful to have found a wonderful place like DeFalco's where they make great Italian food.  \n\nAs I have stated before, if you want a fancy place go there,but if you want great, inexpensive, consistent Italian food,go to DeFalco's.... \n\nOMG, make sure you have some of their desserts..","643007":"Just go here and eat all of things!  Penne a la Vodka is definitely a main to try! The Arancini has an amazing red sauce it comes with.  As you would expect this place is very authentic and bonus points for picking out your wine and then eating your way through the menu!  We ordered so many mains to try that we ended up skipping dessert but this will happen when we come back!","644110":"Went there for lunch today and it was sooo good. The pizza was delish! Authentic Italian New York style awesomeness- this jersey girl would know! The meat, the cheese, the sauce, the crust... it was all yummy. I highly recommend and would definitely go there again.","644370":"Defalco' s the best in Scottsdale. Great sandwiches. , calzone's and every other Italian delite you could think of.  Reasonable price's but most of all geat food. Love this place.!!!!!!","644531":"Defalco's is a great stop for all things Italian and while you are at it don't forget to sample things from the deli .. this is as authentic as it gets.\nThe sandwiches and pizza are some of the best in the valley, made to order ,fresh and delicious.\n\nThey have a full menu at the deli including pastas,calzones,soup,salad and dessert.The seating is cozy and while it may not be a full blown restaurant the food is a must try.\n\nMy personal favourites are the cold and hot sandwiches\/subs.\nPortions are generous pricing is reasonable i like that you can get half portions.The wait is sometimes a little on the higher side but totally worth it.\n\nCheers!","644757":"Great, family like service.\n\nFrom NY, and it definitely had the feel of an old school deli joint.  Good people, great food....very comfortable. Felt like I was back in the old neighborhood\n\nWe went with a couple sandwiches....the meatball parm was awesome. I had it on a baguette. The meatballs was juicy and full of flavor. The baguette was crunchy, doughy and plain old great. Big Fan.\n\nThe wife had the capacolla, hard salami and provolone on sub roll and it was awesome too. She wanted a little extra Italian dressing but they were quick to oblige. \n\nNext time, will try their supposed \"best cheese steak sandwich\"\nWill surely make the 20 minute trip there again !\n\nAlso, for those from the East Coast looking for your Stella Dora products, the have them all."},"date":{"109":"2013-01-27 17:54:54","1013":"2015-04-15 04:50:56","1204":"2011-03-20
